<div id="summary-0" class="summary" style="display: none;">You’ve probably seen AI write emails, generate images, or help you code. But here’s the thing most people haven’t noticed yet: The biggest shift in AI isn’t happening on your screen. It’s happening in the real world.

We’re entering a new era of AI one where machines don’t just think or chat, but actually move, see, and act in physical space.

This video breaks down what might be the most important, and most overlooked, transformation in tech happening today.

We’ll dive into:
- What spatial and embodied AI really are and why they’re more than just buzzwords
- The robots already living in our homes, like AI-powered vacuums that map your space and clean up without you lifting a finger
- How smart glasses and headsets are learning to understand the world around you, not just display information
- Why factories, farms, and hospitals are quietly filling up with intelligent machines that work alongside people
- What’s made this possible now, including cheaper sensors, smarter models, and edge AI that runs directly on devices

And why this changes everything from accessibility and elder care to logistics, automation, and how we interact with technology

And it’s going to shape the next decade in ways most people haven’t realized yet.

Because we’re not just using AI anymore we’re starting to live with it.

If you’re curious about where tech is really heading, not just the flashy headlines but the stuff that will actually impact your daily life , this video is for you.</div>

Doug Jung serves as showrunner and executive produces along with Sibbett, Peter Chernin, Jenno Topping, Tracey Cook and Brian Mendoza. Justin Chon directs the first two episodes and serves as executive producer. Anders Engstrom, Jim Rowe, Molly Allen, Francis Lawrence and Tim Van Patten also serve as executive producers. Grammy and Academy Award winning composer, Hans Zimmer wrote the theme music and co-produced the score for all nine episodes with composer, James Everingham, during his tenure with Bleeding Fingers Music, the multiple Emmy Award-winning and BAFTA-nominated composer collective co-founded by Zimmer in 2013.

Say hello to Samsung’s thinnest, lightest, most powerful foldable yet - the Galaxy Z Fold7. I’ve been folding and unfolding this premium device for 2.5 weeks straight, and now it’s time for the *real-world* review! 🙌

In this video, I cover everything from the updated Flex Hinge and thinner body to the powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, and yep - that glorious 8" display. I also dive into why Samsung ditched the S Pen support, how the cameras performed during a concert at Red Rocks, gaming benchmarks, and battery life for daily use. 💪

💬 Let me know in the comments: Would you replace your phone AND tablet with the Fold7?

Thanks to Samsung for letting me test the Fold7 - as always, all opinions are my own.

<div id="summary-16" class="summary" style="display: none;">I sat down with AI expert Gary Marcus, Professor Emeritus at New York University, at Black Hat 2025, where he broke down the release of GPT-5 and how it compares to GPT-4. He explains why the upgrade is incremental rather than revolutionary, why it’s still plagued by hallucinations and reasoning errors, and why it remains far from achieving Artificial General Intelligence. He also points out that GPT-5 performed worse than Elon Musk’s Grok 4 on the ARC-AGI-2 benchmark and discusses what this means for the AI race.

<div id="summary-23" class="summary" style="display: none;">Bazzite has shown me how frame rates really don't matter all that much when it comes to single player games. 40fps dips are completely fine as long as the game is running smooth with VRR.I've been using fraps for every game since 2002. Just constantly checking the frames. Even after I bought one of the first GSYNC module monitors back in the day, I was using fraps to look at frames. When it dropped to 40fps I used to think man this sucks...Now that I've built a bazzite machine, I have 0 clue on how to install fraps or look at the performance frames and I've been testing a few games out only to notice that frames really don't matter all that much to me anymore. I know some games are going from 130fps and dropping down to 70fps and even 40fps in some scenes but guess what? I don't feel it, I can't see it, I don't notice it and all I notice is the games story and the graphics.In the past, I constantly had my eye on the top right hand corner every other second lol and when it dipped to 40, I could feel it because my eyes saw 40 fps. Now when I play games at 1080p with a resolution modifier of 4k, i know there is no way my comp is maintaining 100fps+ and it has to be dipping to 40fps but the great thing is, I don't notice it or feel it because of the VRR.submitted by/u/Unhappywageslave[link][comments]</div>

Grounded 2 isn't even finished yet, and it's already one of the best survival crafters money can buy. A few bugs (heh) to iron out, but overall this is looking fantastic.

From a larger waterfall display and new S11 chip to long-awaited features like SOS satellite connectivity, 5G, and even a high blood pressure alert sensor, this is shaping up to be Apple’s most advanced wearable yet.

<div id="summary-37" class="summary" style="display: none;">Hey folks,I’m still kinda new to Linux, so please be gentle. I first discovered it about a year ago thanks to my Steam Deck, and for the past few months I’ve been using desktop mode as my main PC. 15 years ago I used also Ubuntu for a while.At first, I was honestly impressed with how much I could do right out of the box. But it didn’t take long to run into situations where you have to use the terminal to get certain things working.A couple of examples:GNOME Boxes (VM for Windows) — Bluetooth passthrough only works if you install it through the terminal.I use a European cloud provider instead of Google Drive, but their client is only available as an AppImage. Personally, I find AppImage distribution a bit frustrating, you have to manually update the app by downloading the new file each time, and it doesn’t integrate into the system like a regular installed program. And yes, I know there are tools like Gearlever (and similar) that can help manage AppImages, but it still feels clunky compared to other installation methodsSo here are my questions:If the dream is for Linux (and open source in general) to go mainstream, why are there so many different app distribution methods?Why isn’t one distro out there that’s truly hassle-free? My father (70+ yo) who can currently understand and use windows, will not be able to use and understand Linux. Is it technically not possible to create a distro which is straight forward like windows and MacOS?Also, about Bazzite: I get that it’s marketed to gamers and comes with Heroic Launcher, Lutris, and Steam preinstalled, but aside from that, it still feels just as complicated (for not tech savvy peaple) as every other distro I’ve tried or heard and read about. I don’t really get why it’s praised as “hassle-free.”One last thing: When people say a distro is “good” or “bad,” most of the time they’re actually talking about the desktop environment or UI, not the distro itself. Am I understanding that right?Curious to hear what you all think.submitted by/u/Harvy784[link][comments]</div>

(Subscribe to our channel: /@residentadvisor  )

Studying sound systems like a scientist, Floating Points (AKA Sam Shepherd) has channelled decades of knowledge into his own audiophile setup, doing so in a way that reflects the powerful roots of sound system culture in the UK and abroad.  Where else can you find banana-shaped tweeters and mycelium acoustic panels?

Over a decade in the making, RA has followed the massive rig to GALA Festival, Glastonbury and Dekmantel where, at each turn, it grew in size, radiating warmth and power.

<p class="published-date">2025-08-08 04:01:08</p>
<p class="feed-title">建築家二人暮らし</p>
<button class="toggle-summary-btn" data-target="summary-43">...</button>
<div id="summary-43" class="summary" style="display: none;">ここ数年「二拠点生活」という言葉をいろんなところで聞くようになって、
私たちも「２つめの家」という暮らしを、
ぼんやりと憧れをもっていました。
でも、「どの地域がいいの？」「いったい費用にどれくらいかかるの？」
「今の暮らしで、そもそも２拠点生活できるの？」と
一歩踏み込むのもハードルが高いと感じていました。

セカンドホームのヒントが得られればと、
「SANU 2nd Home」のサブスクを、
自分たちにとっては、実験的な感覚で数ヶ月ほど試してみることにしました。
https://x.gd/LHkGD

自然豊かな地域を中心に展開されていて、
空いていればいろんな施設を横断して体験できるから、
セカンドホームだけじゃなく、
「この地域の雰囲気、こんなに良かったんだ」
「良いお店が周辺に多いね」
「美味しい野菜や魚介が食べれる」
などなど、“地域”も込みで好きになれたり
「そこでの暮らし」の解像度がとても上がる
面白い体験になっています。

ちょっと興味あるという人にも参考になれば嬉しいです。

Removing this would shift responsibility from users to platform operators, using threats and financial regulatory pressure. The result: massive over-censorship, fewer online communities, and severe limits on creative expression.This isn’t just about a few games — it affects all user-generated content, from fan art and mods to anime and manga discussion spaces.Here’s the original investigative video: [the video] Please share it — it may be removed soon.

<div id="summary-68" class="summary" style="display: none;">I work internal IT, it's just me and 1 other guy. Overall the job is great and management and coworkers are really nice, even guy and I get along and joke, but he is just endlessly incompetent.Earlier this week we had a new hire start. I let guy set up their computer ahead of time and specifically told him to join it to the domain and not do the company portal join method (something we have gone through numerous times). New hire mentions that they aren't getting a prompt to reset their password, and I instantly know that guy did not listen to me AGAIN and decided to do it his way despite him having already dealt with this exact issue previously. So I just fixed it.I explained our user accounts are local to the DC and he needs to do hybrid join or else many things won't work. He then says "oh I should probably do that for all the other PCs that I just deployed". Yes it was his project to replace our old devices (windows 10 EOL prep).THIS IS WHERE IT GETS REALLY BAD.Yesterday he mentions to me that the Microsoft secure score recommends that we make all of our devices hybrid. I quote "so if I make all of the devices hybrid, our secure score will go up!". I explained again what hybrid is and how we are already primarily hybrid.WAIT IT GETS WORSE!Today he goes "Microsoft says I can increase our secure score if I disable all of the cookies on edge browsers".Even typing this it sounds fake Jesus Christ.I'm explaining that we can't disable all cookies and he's saying we can and another coworker (who is not in IT, cause again it's just us two) explains cookies to him and why we can't block them all. He is still on the fence but relents after I repeatedly tell him not to and say "ok do it, but I'm not saving you from (our boss) this time."I really wish I was rage baiting or karma farming but I just fucking can't dude it's been over a year and a half and guy still can't remember to fucking domain join our desktops.I talked to my manager tonight. The cookie thing was really just too much. Manager almost had a panic attack before I told him I stopped guy. Manager said he's gonna have a chat with guy but I really don't know how you would deal with that. He's literally in a cyber security university course and he doesn't know what cookies are???I'm getting stoned tonight.submitted by/u/Free-Tea-3422[link][comments]</div>

Subscribe for more optimistic science and tech stories.

I interviewed Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. They’re trying to build a “superintelligence” that could far exceed humans in almost every field – and they just released their most powerful tool yet, GPT-5.

A few years ago, that would’ve sounded like science fiction! Not anymore. In fact, they’re not alone. We’re in the middle of the most high stakes global race any of us have ever seen. Hundreds of billions of dollars and an unbelievable amount of human work…

It’s a profound moment. Most people never see a huge technological shift like this in their lives and it’s happening all around us right now. So in this conversation, I’m going to try to time travel into the future with Sam Altman, to see what he’s trying to build… so you and I can really understand what’s coming.

<div id="summary-86" class="summary" style="display: none;">My goal for these posts are simple: people should be able to enjoy the games they legitimately own in whatever computing environment they prefer. Be it for security isolation, OS preference, or hardware constraints.Disclaimer: This post is purely educational and explores the technical mechanisms behind CPU timing detection. I am not encouraging anyone to bypass anti-cheat systems. Attempting to circumvent these protections typically results in being kicked from games when caught but they may change their tune at any-point and thus result in account bans. This information is provided to help people understand the technical challenges of VM gaming and the reality that many games can indeed run in virtual machines despite common misconceptions.The "Impossible" VM Gaming MythFollowing myprevious article on EA Javelin, I received numerous replies both here and elsewhere claiming that games with RDTSC timing checks simply "cannot run in VMs" or "results in immediate bans" and that virtualization is fundamentally incompatible with modern anti-cheat systems.This isn't true.While challenging, the technical barriers can be understood and, addressed without reprocussions.What Are RDTSC Timing Checks?RDTSC (Read Time Stamp Counter) timing checks are one of the most sophisticated VM detection methods used by modern games. Unlike simple CPUID checks that look for hypervisor signatures, timing checks measure the actualperformance characteristicsof CPU instructions to detect virtualization overhead.The Detection MechanismHere's the actual code pattern that games like those using BattlEye and Easy Anti-Cheat employ:static inline unsigned long long rdtsc_diff_vmexit() { unsigned long long ret, ret2; unsigned eax, edx; // Get initial timestamp __asm__ volatile("rdtsc" : "=a" (eax), "=d" (edx)); ret = ((unsigned long long)eax) | (((unsigned long long)edx) << 32); // Run an instruction that will cause the VM to have to pass back to the host CPU natively. CPUID is an example of this __asm__ volatile("cpuid" : /* no output */ : "a"(0x00)); // Get timestamp after VM exit __asm__ volatile("rdtsc" : "=a" (eax), "=d" (edx)); ret2 = ((unsigned long long)eax) | (((unsigned long long)edx) << 32); return ret2 - ret; } int detect_virtualization() { unsigned long long avg = 0; // Run test multiple times for accuracy (10 times in this example) for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) { avg += rdtsc_diff_vmexit(); Sleep(500); } avg = avg / 10; // Real hardware: <750 cycles, VM: 1200+ cycles return (avg < 750 && avg > 0) ? 0 : 1; }Why This WorksOn Real Hardware:CPUID executes natively in ~50-200 CPU cycles (This range is to accommodate for different CPUs)Timing is consistent and predictableAverage difference stays well under 750 cycles which they use as a bar to flag VMs.In Virtual Machines:CPUID causes expensive VM exit (guest → hypervisor transition)KVM must process the CPUID instruction in host contextVM exit + processing + VM entry overhead:1,200-2,000+ cyclesThe timing difference immediately reveals virtualizationThis is fundamentally different from hiding CPU vendor strings or disabling hypervisor CPUID bits. As those are flat commands, this is a dynamic, runtime check I.e it's measuring the actualcomputational overheadthat virtualization creates.A Working Solution: kvm-rdtsc-hackWhile I won't detail how to bypass EA's Javelin anti-cheat specifically (and this will not work on it anyways), there are legitimate tools for addressing RDTSC timing detection in general VM scenarios.Thekvm-rdtsc-hackkernel module by h33p provides a working solution for many RDTSC-based detection systems that use the CPUID has the testing method.(NOTE THIS IS BECOMING LESS AND LESS COMMON):# Clone and build the module git clone https://github.com/h33p/kvm-rdtsc-hack cd kvm-rdtsc-hack make # Load with appropriate timing offset sudo insmod kvm-rdtsc-hack.ko constant_tsc_offset=1600With the module does is intercepts KVM's RDTSC handling and provides fake timing values:// Core logic from the actual module source static void vcpu_pre_run(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu) { u64 cur_tsc, off, tsc_offset, new_tsc_offset; struct vcpu_offset_info *off_info; tsc_offset = vcpu->arch.l1_tsc_offset; off_info = get_cpu_offset_info(vcpu); if (off_info->called_cpuid) { // Calculate fake timing to mimic real hardware cur_tsc = rdtsc(); off = -kvm_scale_tsc(vcpu, constant_tsc_offset + cur_tsc - off_info->vmexit_tsc); new_tsc_offset += off; off_info->temp_offset += off; } // Apply the fake offset to make VM exits appear faster if (tsc_offset ^ new_tsc_offset) vcpu->arch.tsc_offset = kvm_x86_ops.write_l1_tsc_offset(vcpu, new_tsc_offset); }Key Insight:Instead of trying to make VM exits faster (hard to do but a better approach), it manipulates the TSC values that the guest sees, making VM exitsappearto take only ~200-400 cycles instead of the real 1,200+ cycles.Timing Offset Values:When setting your timing remember that Higher values = lower apparent timing, but risk backwards time progression as such on average you want to set it appropriately for your CPU:Intel systems: typically 1000-1200AMD Ryzen: typically 1400-1800Testing Your Setup:# Use pafish or similar detection tool ./pafish # Should show: [PASS] RDTSC VM exit timing checkLimitations and Reality CheckThis Approach Has LimitsEA Javelin: Uses additional detection vectors beyond RDTSC checks that this method doesn't addressPerformance Impact: RDTSC interception adds measurable overhead (~2-5%)Maintenance: Kernel modules need updates for new kernel versionsEA's Javelin anti-cheat implements multiple detection layers so this alone would never work:RDTSC timing checks(what this method addresses)Hardware performance counter analysisvia APERF/MPERF MSRsCache timing attacksmeasuring L1/L2/L3 cache access patternsMemory access pattern detectionfor VM memory management signaturesSystem call timing analysismeasuring syscall overhead differencesThe kvm-rdtsc-hack module only addresses layer 1. EA Javelin's additional detection vectors remain unaffected, which is why this specific approach doesn't work against current EA titles.submitted by/u/KstrlWorks[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-107" class="summary" style="display: none;">Meet GPT-5 — our most capable model yet. It figures out how hard to think, which tools to use, and suggests next steps so you can get from idea to execution faster.

In this demo, watch GPT-5 take our fictional company from messy customer feedback data to a working travel-app prototype in minutes. You’ll see it:
- Dynamically adjust reasoning effort for each task
- Analyze messy CSV data and prioritize feature requests
- Create in-chat charts, graphs, and tables
- Draft a Product Requirements Document (PRD) and user stories
- Build an interactive front-end prototype in Canvas
- Summarize everything into an executive memo with visuals

There’s no need for model-picking or complex prompt-engineering. GPT-5 is a powerful AI partner that adapts to your workflow and delivers results you can trust.

Justin Chon directs the first two episodes and serves as executive producer. Anders Engstrom, Jim Rowe, Molly Allen, Francis Lawrence and Tim Van Patten also serve as executive producers. Grammy and Academy Award winning composer, Hans Zimmer wrote the theme music and co-produced the score for all nine episodes with composer, James Everingham, during his tenure with Bleeding Fingers Music, the multiple Emmy Award-winning and BAFTA-nominated composer collective co-founded by Zimmer in 2013.

<div id="summary-126" class="summary" style="display: none;">I know where we're going.In a few years, Outlook classic will cease to exist. I don't particularly like the Outlook client, I think as a general rule that it's pretty bad at a simple task. But how worse can a new software made by a multi billion dollar company can be ?Much worse.I work for a quite large law firm and they have strict requirements for about everything. This week, I started working on a way to strictly control how we deploy signatures.At first, I explored Exclaimer and CodeTwo, but both demand that we reroute all mails to them for maximum control, which is a no no for our line of business. So I thought "How hard can it be to powershell my way out of it ?"Turns out, with Outlook classic, it's fairly easy. After two days work, I automated about everything you can think of, from deploying multiple languages, so conditionnally inserting the lawyer's title / rank / diploma, generating a vcar with a picture encoded, dynamically linking the lawyer's linkedin and website profile, and so on.And believe it or not, it even sync'd to the new outlook / web outlook. Just not quite the correct display, just a few tweaks and... no.There is basically zero customization you can do in this Outlook version. You can pick line spacing, it automatically underlines links even if you disable or explicitly disable underline on links (it comes back later), spaces are randomly trimmed...I paused for a moment and took a moment to look at how the New Outlook worked, and it dawned on me : it lacks at least 80% of the original client's functionalities, but even worse, they are hidden behind icons instead of text buttons wich makes finding the think you're looking for much harder.At this point, I am contemplating the possibility of switching to another client such as Thunderbird.With Microsoft, everything gets worse every year. The only thing I like that was added in the past 5 years or so was the whole SSO ecosystem which is probably the main selling point to me. I just wish the main tool I'm working on wasn't on a path of complete enshittification.submitted by/u/Alzzary[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-127" class="summary" style="display: none;">One of our Berlin-based HR managers offboarded an employee in Argentina. Simple task, right? Deactivate accounts, recover the company laptop, send good vibes.But here’s whatactuallyhappened:DHL picked up the laptop.Argentina customs flagged the shipment.We were asked to provide original purchase receipts, IMEI, serial number, and a declaration signed by theoriginal buyer- who left the company 4 years ago.The ex-employee got furious. Thought we were invading privacy. Didn’t return the mouse.The laptop sat in Buenos Aires for 22 days. The customs fee? More than the device’s value. DHL kept askingusto sort it out.Eventually, we told customs to keep the damn thing and we bought a new one.This was 2024. Not 1997.What’s your worst device return story?submitted by/u/Slow-Youth5400[link][comments]</div>

<p class="published-date">2025-08-07 08:00:01</p>
<p class="feed-title">MacRumors</p>
<button class="toggle-summary-btn" data-target="summary-135">...</button>
<div id="summary-135" class="summary" style="display: none;">After using the iPhone 16e for over 4 months as both a main and secondary phone, I can confidently say: this is still one of the best bang-for-your-buck iPhones you can buy. At $599 MSRP (often cheaper with deals), it nails the essentials — and then some.

✅ Minimalist design – Clean look with a single 48MP camera
✅ Great performance – Powered by Apple’s A18 chip + Apple Intelligence
✅ Excellent battery life – Thanks to the new C1 modem & no ProMotion
✅ Reliable display – 6.1" panel without Dynamic Island or 120Hz, but solid
✅ Build quality – No case? Still barely any scratches
✅ Camera system – 48MP main sensor with solid 2x zoom crop
✅ No MagSafe? – Workarounds exist with magnetic cases
✅ C1 Modem – Better thermal management and strong cellular performance
✅ Downsides? – No telephoto lens, no MagSafe, no ProMotion

If you’re coming from an iPhone 12 or older and want to save money without sacrificing too much, the iPhone 16e is a top-tier choice — especially with Apple Intelligence on board.

<div id="summary-139" class="summary" style="display: none;">They built a multi-million dollar AI company by going against Silicon Valley's playbook.

Jordan (CEO) and Michael (CTO) are the co-founders of Comulate — a startup that’s quietly transforming the insurance industry using AI.

While most founders try to solve their own tech-world problems, they went the other way — diving into a space full of outdated workflows, skepticism, and "we don’t need your services" pushback. That same company that rejected them? Now one of their largest customers.

This is a story about building genuine product-market fit, uncovering overlooked problems, and simplifying complexity with AI — all by listening more deeply than anyone else in the field.

Are you chasing what’s trendy — or actually solving a real problem?

<div id="summary-141" class="summary" style="display: none;">Apple’s iPhone 17 Air is shaping up to be the boldest design move we’ve seen in years. Thinner than ever before (just 5.5mm!), lighter in the hand, and aiming to balance premium materials with everyday usability — but it comes with some major trade-offs. No ultrawide camera, no bottom speaker, and a surprisingly small battery. So who is this ultra-thin iPhone really for? Let’s break down everything we know, from release dates and design to performance, pricing, and what you’re giving up for that sleek new form factor.

The drama is showrun and executive produced by Stoudt, and directed and executive produced by Leder. The series is produced by the studio Media Res, and executive produced by Michael Ellenberg and Lindsey Springer through Media Res, along with Stoudt and Leder. Aniston and Kristin Hahn executive produce through Echo Films, while Witherspoon executive produces alongside Lauren Neustadter for Hello Sunshine. Zander Lehmann and Micah Schraft also executive produce.

Because of this, I’m considering switching GPUs entirely and selling my current card.I’m aiming to get the best GPU possible within a ~$1200 budget (probably AMD?). I’m also curious about what kind of performance differences I can expect, and how a new GPU might affect features like DLSS, Frame Generation, and FSR when running Bazzite.Would love to hear any advice or experiences.

Welcome to a realm where neon circuits pulse like heartbeats, and analog dreams blaze across chrome horizons 🌌⚡. This isn't just a playlist — it's a cybernetic transmission from a parallel retro-future, coded in synths, soaked in nostalgia, and wrapped in digital stardust 🌠🔮.

🎶 Let the basslines bend your timeline.
Immerse in electric skies, pixelated emotions, and hyperspeed highways where the soundtrack writes itself 🚘🌈. Feel every arpeggio like a memory of a future that never happened — yet somehow did.

💡 This is audio-immersion.
A neon-drenched hallucination designed to reboot your soul. No boundaries. No gravity. Just YOU, the night, and the sound of forever.

Press play. Enter the loop. Become the vibe.

🎧 Upload complete.

<div id="summary-159" class="summary" style="display: none;">Alright so me and my buddy tried Bazzite for a few hours yesterday. Apart from his desktop environment getting corrupted due to some shennanagins with wallpaper engine, I have to say we both did not want to go back to windows.Bazzite was honestly such a PLEASANT experience. It ran well out the box, everything loaded fine, couple of hiccups with my razer gear but other than that no major issues.Main issue which is actually just minor, wallpaper engine's audio responsive wallpapers just dont seem to work, idk how to fix that but its not a deal breaker.Genuinely if it wasnt for the fact that I want to develop games, edit videos, and a couple of other things I genuienly would have stayed with Bazzite.NO THIS IS NOT A PAID SPONSORSHIP, THIS IS GENUIENLY HOW I FEELsubmitted by/u/mephisto9466[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-161" class="summary" style="display: none;">Got a LegionGo for my birthday last year. It was an instantly converted to Bazzite, and I haven't looked back. This year, I got two docks for it (second picture) - one for port extension and one for an eGPU (a cheapo AliExpress one, in which I placed a 7600xt). It fully replaced my desktop as a primary gaming machine.- Want a console experience? Hook up a controller. Or five.- Want it on the Go? Undock, rehook controllers to the main unit, off you go.It's totally not as beefy as a this-gen-ryzen combined with a 5080, but I don't think I care. I'm happy with this :)submitted by/u/Standard_Ferret4700[link][comments]</div>

The Belgian production duo are known in part for their masterful reworks and in this RA Exchange, the Dewaele brothers talk about remixing as reinvention, switching creative hats between Soulwax and 2manydjs and how setting strict rules actually unlocks more freedom.

<div id="summary-168" class="summary" style="display: none;">Hey!Long-time lurker, first time poster. I hope this post doesn't break any rules...I wrote my own cross-platform game launcher (I know, what a unique project /s).Since I am a Linux user and according to Steam did 90% of my gaming in 2024 under Linux, I have naturally been developing this with Linux as a focus, and not only Windows. It is currently in what I would call a proof-of-concept state. There will some weird and broken behavior, but I hope you can find some value in it while it's being developed.The video is a showcase of the launcher running what would be a fresh installation.Some of the main selling points are:Light weight: Low resource usageQuick: Launches practically instantly compared to "competition"Cross-platform: Compiles for Windows, MacOS and Linux. Currently only developing features for Windows and Linux.Working on supporting games acrossmultiple stores.Open SourceAttempts to beprivacy preservingandsecureCommunity driven: You can get your voice heard and let me know what you want to see more of in the future.I'm going to keep this brief so that I don't bore anyone to sleep. I'm currently looking for help in developing this project. Anyone who is interested in contributing in any way, shape, or form is welcome to DM me.What I specifically need the most help with is web development (I am not a web developer). The launcher is written with a Rust backend but a (partially vibe-coded) React UI using Tauri. But anyone who would like to help with docs, Rust, UI/UX, infrastructure, security, you name it... is of course welcome.If you don't want to or know how to contribute you can simply use it if you want to and let me know what you think :)Link to website:https://monarch-launcher.com/Link to project on GitHub:https://github.com/Monarch-Launcher/Monarchsubmitted by/u/An0nymooze[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-169" class="summary" style="display: none;">Big audio season ahead. 🎧

In the next few months, I’ll be diving deeper into music production and audio-related work.

That means you can expect more content on audio workflows, gear tips, and sound design systems. Especially helpful if you’re a creator, editor, or video-first storyteller. ✨ If you can remember, one of my goals this month is to help at least 5 people become more productive and improve their workflow. So I just wanted to follow through with that!

Let me know which topics you’d love to see covered—whether it’s EQ basics, fixing muddy audio, or setting up your ideal sound chain.

✨ Happy Thursday, and thanks for sticking around.

Home to a young couple working in art and fashion, this split-level Paris apartment by architect Anthony Authié of Zyva Studio, blends functionality with surreal, cartoon-like flourishes—creating an imaginative and immersive home across three levels. The revamped layout introduces bold statement elements like a bright blue metallic staircase that appears to float between levels and a custom-built bookshelf inspired by Swiss graphic design. Stainless steel kitchen cabinetry is softened by sunrise-inspired curves and bright blue 3D-printed knobs, while concrete floors ground the whimsical elements. Authié designed and built much of the furniture himself—from animal-shaped chairs and spiked rosebush-inspired coffee tables to cactus-like lamps. Upstairs, a new walk-in wardrobe, a soft grey bed with integrated storage, and a bathroom clad in lush green tiles channel the vibe of a tropical greenhouse.

We’re talking up to 10x ray tracing over PS5, RDNA 5 architecture, 4K120 capabilities, and a portable with serious power. I break down what’s real, what’s rumored, and when we might actually see them in action.

<div id="summary-205" class="summary" style="display: none;">I've seen this in a couple places now and would like to raise awareness.People are calling us about their mouse mysteriously moving in the middle of the day(I work for an MSP), and a few times now it has ended up being someone unauthorized using a ScreenConnect client that was installed months or years ago by a vendor that previously provided support for <something> on the customer's PC.The software does not remove itself when that vendor disconnects, and it runs as a service.I'm suspecting this is fallout from when ScreenConnect was compromised back in May.Check your computers for a "ScreenConnect Client (xxxxx...)" service and look for application log event id's 100 & 101 to see if it's being misused.Stay safe out there!submitted by/u/bcredeur97[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-226" class="summary" style="display: none;">When it comes to EDC backpacks, function can often reign supreme. However, our aesthetic sensibilities will undoubtedly play a big role in our purchasing decision. Tactical bags are great, but if you’re like us, you’re also suckers for bags with minimal-to-no branding, few external pockets, and overall clean designs. Shining a light on this “less-is-more” mentality, we’ve gotten hands-on with the best men’s minimalist backpacks for everyday carry.

Ghislaine Maxwell is doing everything she can to end and escape her punishment. But you must not believe her. Maxwell was the right-hand woman of Jeffrey Epstein to whom she was a girlfriend as well as a top manager of Epstein’s clandestine trafficking operation.

Now Maxwell is begging the Supreme Court, the Congress as well as the President of the United States to get her conviction overturned, get clemency or an outright pardon. 

This would be a disastrous blow to the criminal justice system as well as a major disservice to the dozens of victims Maxwell was found guilty of abusing along with Epstein. 

But the worst part of this is that some conservative commentators are now claiming that Maxwell might be trusted to tell the truth and they are regurgitating her new line of defense – that she wasn’t a co-conspirator in Epstein’s criminal enterprise – but that she was his victim. [

I’ve been watching tutorials on YouTube and seeing how things work. I’m using my ROG Ally to test things out. It’s a huge learning curve compared to Windows. I do want at one point make a dual boot gaming PC but I wanna make sure before I make the final decision. So far I’m enjoying Bazzite. Games do run better even if it’s a few more frames. My battery life has seen improvements. Are there any issues?submitted by/u/Aggressive_Body_7025[link][comments]</div>

<button class="toggle-summary-btn" data-target="summary-238">...</button>
<div id="summary-238" class="summary" style="display: none;">Why does it feel like our focus is constantly under attack—and what can we actually do about it? In this episode of the Dual Comm Podcast, we dig into the quiet, everyday battles for our attention, from endless phone scrolling to multitasking ourselves into brain fog. We talk about the lost joy of doing one thing at a time, the value of being bored, and how simple habits—like listening to an album start to finish or playing a game without a second screen—can help restore our attention span. We also get into the comeback of physical media, why buying CDs and ripping DVDs has become unexpectedly satisfying, and how infinite streaming choice might be making us less happy. Later in the episode, we talk Halo 3 playlist design, why modern FPS games miss the mark on fun, and a productivity warning signal to watch out for. It’s part nostalgia, part reflection, and part reminder that the best way to protect your focus might be to slow down, log off, and embrace the quiet moments. #gaming #gamingvideos

<div id="summary-246" class="summary" style="display: none;">The Mac Studio delivers the highest performance Apple Silicon available - the extremely powerful M3 Ultra - and Apple has supplied us with a unit for testing. In this extensive review, Oliver tests out CPU and GPU performance, delivering a range of benchmarks - including AI workloads. The integrated CPU is tested up against prior Apple flagship silicon, alongside the powerful Ryzen 9 9950X, while the GPU is stacked up against Nvidia's impressive RTX 5080. Production workflow impressions, gaming performance, it's all here. 

Note: the 3DMark RTX 5080 results are towards the lower percentiles among sampled RTX 5080 GPUs.

<div id="summary-252" class="summary" style="display: none;">Tucked into a steep hillside in Los Angeles, the Kallis Residence is a striking example of Schindler’s mastery of site-sensitive design. Created in 1946 for artist and film art director Mischa Kallis, the home embraces the contours of the slope with a dynamic composition of overlapping volumes and carefully placed terraces. After purchasing the home in 2017, homeowners John Gillespie and Susan Orlean embarked on a meticulous, multi-year restoration. Having previously lived in another Schindler-designed residence nearby, they understood the potential hidden beneath years of wear and neglect—and were committed to bringing the home back to its original brilliance. 

Originally conceived as two distinct structures—a modest one-bedroom residence and a separate two-bedroom studio—the design cleverly linked these spaces via an outdoor terrace that was later enclosed, creating a more cohesive interior environment.Schindler’s signature architectural language—bold geometric forms, extensive glazing, and built-in furnishings—gives the house its sculptural and expressive quality. One of its most distinctive features is a vertical wood-slat screen that runs along the downslope façade, simultaneously acting as a privacy element and a subtle way to integrate the home into the natural landscape. 

In the 1960s, the home was acquired by members of Kallis’s extended family, William and Jacqueline Sharlin. Working with architect Josef Van der Kar, a colleague of Schindler’s, they updated and unified the residence, blending the original two wings into a more fluid living space. Recognized as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument, the Kallis-Sharlin Residence is a powerful reminder of Schindler’s legacy. It reflects his deep commitment to designing for both the landscape and the individual—a philosophy that helped shape the Southern California modernist movement.

<div id="summary-255" class="summary" style="display: none;">Are we serious? I continue to receive this complaint from countless clerical staff. Why are we still using fax machines? "Well its HIPPA LAW!" actually with the protocols we need to use to make this ancient technology work with modern day machines, its violating HIPPA law, but what do I know? I just plug in the machine and make it go.At what point are we allowed to remove the dinosaurs from the equation? Are we allowed to say adapt or leave? We pay for encryption for our emails, separate from the already provided encryption. But no I'm sure your fax is more secure right?I'm sure the fax machine is always attended and the POI is never just left sitting in the tray for hours. I'm sure the DOT or DOH or who every you're faxing loves sitting by a fax all day instead of just receiving it in an inbox.I can't with this stupid need to hold on to antiquated things because Judith only knows how to send a fax.Edit to add… obviously Judith is getting her MFP with fax line, it’s not a big deal. Just a rant about a lack of technical evolution in certain fields.submitted by/u/rfisher23[link][comments]</div>

<p class="feed-title">Patch My PC</p>
<button class="toggle-summary-btn" data-target="summary-257">...</button>
<div id="summary-257" class="summary" style="display: none;">Your Intune remote wipe says it worked, but your device still boots like nothing happened. Here’s why… and how to fix it before your compliance team panics.

In this episode of Patch Me If You Can, we dive deep into the weird world of “phantom wipes” when Windows pretends to reset but actually does… nothing.

Turns out, a sneaky component introduced in the May 2025 Windows update (thanks, Recall!) is quietly breaking your remote wipes by failing mid-process. We show you:

• How to identify a failed remote wipe (even when the portal says it’s gone)
• Which logs to check 
• The exact folder that gives the game away
• And how a little “stupid” file deletion fixed it (yes, really)

Whether you’re a seasoned Intune admin or just tired of unreliable resets, this is a must-watch tech breakdown, complete with sarcasm, screenshots, and some questionable life choices.

See why over 8,000 organizations trust Patch My PC to handle secure, automated updates.

<div id="summary-258" class="summary" style="display: none;">On July 22, 2025, the European police agency Europol said a long-running investigation led by the French Police resulted in the arrest of a 38-year-old administrator of XSS, a Russian-language cybercrime forum with more than 50,000 members. The action has triggered an ongoing frenzy of speculation and panic among XSS denizens about the identity of the unnamed suspect, but the consensus is that he is a pivotal figure in the crime forum scene who goes by the hacker handle "Toha." Here's a deep dive on what's knowable about Toha, and a short stab at who got nabbed.</div>

<div id="summary-260" class="summary" style="display: none;">"We're trying to show more of who we are." The Belgian brothers unpack their decades-long career and first album in more than seven years.

There are some songs that have become pervasive, nearly universally recognisable features of pop culture. And my guess is that even if you don't know the Belgian duo Soulwax (AKA 2Manydjs) by name, you'll know their biggest hits, like early 2000s indie electronic anthems "E Talking" or "NY Excuse."

In this interview with Resident Advisor editor Gabriel Szatan, the brothers David and Stephen Dewaele talk about their decades-long career and writing their first album in more than seven years, All Systems Are Lying, which they road tested for ages before deciding to put it out. They also unpack bigger thematic arcs in their work and lives: the abiding influence of New Order's Power, Corruption and Lies LP; their creative philosophy ("If it sounds too simple, leave it alone);" and the nature of musical trends and revivals, which have fluctuated intensely since they began performing and releasing records. Listen to the episode in full.

Lately, the weather’s been moody: aka raining one minute, scorching hot the next. But after a long stretch of rainfall, the sun finally showed up again.

Had to take a few shots of the living room bathed in natural light. There’s just something about sunlight that makes a space feel alive. ☀️

Don’t forget to step outside and get your daily dose of Vitamin D. Happy midweek, fam!

<div id="summary-283" class="summary" style="display: none;">Two unforgettable performances. One Adam Scott. Severance Season 2 is now streaming on Apple TV+ http://apple.co/_Severance

From Ben Stiller and creator Dan Erickson, Severance centers around Mark Scout (Adam Scott), a leader of a team of office workers whose memories have been surgically divided between their work and personal lives. 

This experiment in ‘work-life balance’ is called into question as Mark finds himself at the center of an unraveling mystery that will force him to confront the true nature of his work… and of himself.  

Severance features Adam Scott, who stars alongside Academy-Award winner Patricia Arquette, Emmy-winner John Turturro, Britt Lower, Zach Cherry, Dichen Lachman, Jen Tullock, Tramell Tillman, Michael Chernus and Academy Award winner Christopher Walken.

The design, which has evolved throughout the beta cycle, is expected to remain largely unchanged until the September launch. While minor tweaks are possible, the current state of Liquid Glass is likely to be the final version.submitted by/u/Fer65432_Plays[link][comments]</div>

In the first season of The Buccaneers, a group of fun-loving young American girls exploded into the tightly corseted London of the 1870s … setting hearts racing and kicking off an Anglo-American culture clash. Now the Buccaneers are no longer the invaders — England is their home. In fact, they’re practically running the place. Nan is the Duchess of Tintagel, the most influential woman in the country. Conchita is Lady Brightlingsea, heroine to a wave of young American heiresses. And Jinny is on every front page, wanted for the kidnapping of her unborn child. All of the girls have been forced to grow up and now have to fight to be heard, as they wrestle with romance, lust, jealousy, births and deaths … themes consuming all women of any age, no matter what year it is. Last time we got a taste of England. This time we’re in for a veritable feast.

Written by series creator Katherine Jakeways, season two is directed by BAFTA Award winner William McGregor, DGA Award winner Rachel Leiterman, John Hardwick and Charlie Manton. Jakeways, BAFTA Award nominee Beth Willis and BAFTA Award winner Susanna White serve as executive producers. “The Buccaneers” is produced for Apple TV+ by The Forge Entertainment, a Banijay UK company.

<div id="summary-293" class="summary" style="display: none;">Apple just dropped iPadOS 26 Beta 5, and while it’s not packed with groundbreaking new features, there are a ton of small improvements and UI refinements that make a big difference. In this video, we walk through all the new splash screens, subtle UI changes, and long-awaited fixes — including a new Camera app toggle, AutoMix in Music, and more. Plus, I share my real-world battery life results using an M4 iPad Pro with heavy apps like LumaFusion and ChatGPT.

<div id="summary-298" class="summary" style="display: none;">TL;DRI quit after years of holding together a collapsing IT environment with duct tape, while management demanded "Cloud First" and then ran production on B-Series VMs, banned PsExec, refused to buy licenses, ignored every warning, and expected branded screensavers as a security strategy.Yes, this is the same vendor as theMSI disasterfrom months ago.This is the sequel - and the end.Context: Yes, This Is a SequelIf the name sounds familiar, it's because it is. I’ve posted before -That post where a vendor required installing the same .msi three times to populate a hosts file with SHA-1 fingerprints into AppData?That was me.This post is the culmination of all that - after years of fighting vendor idiocy, management blindness, and IT burnout.Wearing many Hat's the same timeAt the time I quit, I was:Primary responsible for:DACH & BENELUX 1st + 2nd-level supportAD-User ManagementAD-PermissionsGPO-ManagementSSPR, WHfB, LAPS, Conditional Access, RBACAzure App RegistrationsMS-Teams (incl.

For six months.We refused. Turkey is malware central, we deal with Viruses, Trojans, and Cracks on external harddrives every single week. Pausing patches = asking for ransomware.The CTO didn’t care. He just told me:Do it anyway.I tried to explain how Intune and Office update channels work. He didn’t even listen.That was the moment I decided to leave.Security Theater 101The same CTO who said "pause Office updates" also:Banned PsExec for "security reasons"Worshipped Secure ScoreHad no clue what Defender for Endpoint actually needs (or how it even works)Refused to license us for anything beyond Microsoft 365 Business Premium and basic Defender for Endpoint licenceBut still wanted full Intune lockdown, security baselines, and brandingWe ran Windows 10 Pro on all clients.No E3. No E5.No advanced threat hunting.No KQL.But he still expected results like we were running an XDR stack on autopilot.Turkey: No Staff, Just Collateral DamageThe Turkey site had no IT staff.Instead, two programmers - actually hired for programming arround ERP - were forced to manage:FirewallsServersMalware cleanupSoftware updatesLocal user supportInfrastructure issues they weren’t even trained forTheir "IT manager"? Delegated everything. Did nothing.Me and my colleague from Poland were doing 3rd-level support for another country which language we don't even speak (guess in which one they setup their systems)?."Cloud First"... Budget LastCTO’s favorite phrase?Cloud First!In practice:Ran production on Azure B-Series VM's (burstable compute)Shut them down every night "to save money"Didn’t realize this killed CPU creditsEvery morning: app servers ran like crapNobody knew whyI diagnosed it myself - even though that wasn't my jobOh - and some of our domain controllers were also running on B-Series, with the swap file placed on the temporary D:\ drive (8GB) in Azure (you know, the one that gets wiped on reboot). No fallback, no logs, no warnings.

I studied IT."(He know's nothing, to be honest).Edit:Today I quit.And soon I’ll be writing an open letter to the board to tell them the truth:If you want the company to have any kind of future, you need to clean house at the topBecause this isn’t "Cloud First."It’sClown First.Instead, I realized (and you guy's convinced me):They don’t deserve that much of my energy. They had years to listen. They didn’t.To everyone who read this far, replied, or just silently nodded along:thank you!Your encouragement, your stories, and your brutal empathy made me realize something i had forgotten:I'm not alone.I'm not crazy.And I’m not the only one who gives a damn.This post won’t change my old company.But maybe it helps someone else realize when it’s time to stop patching a burning ship - and start building something better somewhere else.Company slogan?Team happy futureYeah.

<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/sS204dCGrtE" target="_blank">Some travelers to the U.S. may soon be required to pay a bond of up to $15,000</a></h2>

<div id="summary-303" class="summary" style="display: none;">A new Trump administration plan will require travelers from certain countries to pay a bond of up to $15,000 before getting a tourist or business visa to enter the U.S. The move from the State Department may make the process unaffordable for many.

The department said it would start a 12-month pilot program under which people from countries deemed to have high overstay rates and deficient internal document security controls could be required to post bonds of $5,000, $10,000 or $15,000 when they apply for a visa.

The proposal comes as the Trump administration is tightening requirements for visa applicants. Last week, the State Department announced that many visa renewal applicants would have to submit to an additional in-person interview, something that was not required in the past.

The countries affected will be listed once the program takes effect. The bond could be waived depending on an applicant’s individual circumstances.</div>

<div id="summary-330" class="summary" style="display: none;">The threat never left, it evolved. Invasion Season 3 premieres August 22 on Apple TV+
https://apple.co/_Invasion

Invasion follows an alien invasion through different perspectives around the world. In season three, those perspectives collide for the first time, as the series’ main characters are brought together to work as a team on a critical mission to infiltrate the alien mothership. The ultimate apex aliens have finally emerged, rapidly spreading their deadly tendrils across the planet. It will take all heroes working together, using their experience and expertise, to save the species. New relationships are formed, old relationships are challenged and even shattered, as an international cast of characters must become a team before it’s too late.

The third season of Invasion stars returning cast members Golshifteh Farahani, Shioli Kutsuna, Shamier Anderson, India Brown, Shane Zaza and Enver Gjokaj, and introduces new series regular Erika Alexander.

Invasion is created by Kinberg and Weil, who also serve as executive producers alongside Audrey Chon, David Witz, Alik Sakharov, Dan Dietz, Katie O’Connell Marsh and Nick Nantell. 

Following its global debut, Invasion has been hailed for “upping the ante” with each season as well as expert cinematography that “captures the beauty and eeriness” of an alien invasion. The first and second seasons of Invasion are now streaming globally on Apple TV+.

<div id="summary-332" class="summary" style="display: none;">I work for a gov office, we have a pretty complex network with a lot of new mixed with old solutions (we're working on it!), but not too messy as we keep things pretty tidy.About 2 months ago things just started.....crashing. When I say things I mean such various things we simply had no idea what was going on. Randomly, parts of completely unrelated systems started crashing. For example a geographic piece of software we run maps on and a storage replica that have nothing to do with each other. This spanned literally anything that has an relation to Windows.Around the same time we started noticing Workstation service is crashing on some of the affected clients and services, but this was pretty rare so we never gave it too much thought even though I literally never saw this service crash in my 10 years here.Now lets go back about a year ago, back then I noticed some servers and clients are failing to update their group policy. A quick google landed me in C:\Windows\System32\GroupPolicy. Delete the contents and the issue goes away. I proceeded to create a SCCM baseline which finds the failed GPUpdate event, and if that happens it just deletes the content of said folder and runs gpupdate /force. This fixed around 95% of the problems. Rarely this didn't manage to fix the issue, at which point we usually fixed manually. My boss decided this is no good and 2 months ago asked our junior SCCM guy to come up with a better solution.You can see where this is going. Junior went to some AI which spat out 2 pieces of PowerShell code, junior applied code in the scripts of said SCCM baseline and went home happy. The code.... It changed the event that decides when to run the remediation script to any event concerning an issue with gpupdate, including warnings, and in the remediation script, on top of a mountain of unneeded BS it contained the following 2 lines:Restart-Service Netlogon -ForceRestart-Service Workstation -ForceThere are a lot of other services that depend on these 2 services and they also depend on each other, and of course things just started falling apart. I can't tell you how many hours of debugging went into this. Global support teams we alerted, product groups running insane debugging tools, we canceled storage replicas, clusters, reinstalled whole RDS farms etc etc etc.6 weeks later I caught a service failing as I was there with procmon running, and saw the script it was running and the folder the script came from. I managed to work my way from there to the baseline.The junior was not fired, even though if he only asked any one of us we would never allow such a script to run.Oh and did I mention, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T BLINDLY TRUST AI ANSWERS.submitted by/u/StrikerXTZ[link][comments]</div>

Data brokers know where you go, what you search, and when you are “in-market” for big-ticket items. In this video I show how location and identity signals are harvested and sold, with real examples from broker marketing and an airport case study that aligns shopping with travel using identity matching and real-time personalised services. I also highlight a serious privacy incident where purchased app location data was used to publicly out someone.

If you want to reduce this exposure, you can try manual removals or use DeleteMe. I personally use DeleteMe to remove my data from 750 data broker sites. Use my link for 20% off: https://joindeleteme.com/bombal

<div id="summary-339" class="summary" style="display: none;">If you are asking the question "Should I switch to Bazzite?" then the simple answer is,ABSO-FREAKING-LUTELY!https://preview.redd.it/aubdzxf3b7hf1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=312f0bd97690c0e0b0db878c7e6377096dbb28c5I was fed up with Windows + WSL2 set up on my desktop. It has so many limitations, bugs and simply just broken in some cases. I have a M4 MacBook Air as well and it's a decent experience but I'm not an Apple person so part of the Apple experience is irrelevant to me.I had a few primary blockers for me in terms of switching to Linux. Linux being Linux wasn't one because I've been using WSL2 Ubuntu distro for quite a while and I've played around with a few Debian based distros on and off (although 80% of my experience is with Ubuntu). I am ok with the terminal and occasional time consuming troubleshoots.My main blockers were:Can I bring all my Dev tools exactly as is to Linux?Can I get Claude Desktop working with MCP support on Linux (because there's no official package)?Can I use Adobe Illustrator on Linux?Can I play World of Warcraft on Linux?Can I use Office 365 on Linux?Can I have a decent multimedia experience without any annoying driver issues, codec issues or just simply broken media experience?Enter Bazzite! A comprehensive solution for my issues.My desktop specs:Ryzen 3700x32GB RAMRTX 3060 12GB GPUMSI MAG B550 Mortar mainboard with WiFi and BluetoothI went with theBazzite Nvidia KDE Desktopedition and then revised it to theBazzite DX Nvidia KDEedition. (Never rebase cross desktop environments i.e.: KDE and GNOME, is what experts say so sure, I'd say the same thing. Anyway, why would you want to ruin your clean distro installation in the first place?)1. Dev Tools and the Dev environmentWith Bazzite DX, VS Code, Podman and Docker comes with the base and I get homebrew built in as well with Distrobox also in the base to cover for containerisation. (Containerisation is quite important as I've learned and more about it a bit later). I've made Podman the primary engine as it doesn't have root access requirements and is generally more secure and slightly better performance too.I use Cursor most of the time and there's an Appimage route to get Cursor working on Bazzite with almost no hassle at all using Gear Lever.Terminal. Now this is a very important part of the overall Dev experience. You want to feel comfortable with your terminal and you want to feel excited to use it. I usually go with zsh as my shell and ohmyzsh for the prompt with powerlevel10k theme and catppuccin mocha colours. Since I'm changing my setup, I decided to venture out and see what other options are out there.My new terminal, is the default KDE terminal. nothing fancy there. it seems like a decent enough terminal and I'm fine with it. The shell however, I switched to Fish! Its different. There indeed is a learning curve because the bash/zsh commands that I know may not work on fish. Curl installation commands is a challenge I encountered almost immediately and I still need to learn how to use it properly. But the good news is, worst case scenario, i can always bash it (which is what i did with the curl commands but I'm sure many people here would 'educate' me on how stupid I'm being without learning how to use fish properly, and yes, I will, eventually, gradually, but the workaround, WORKS and I just want to let another newbie know that).So... FISH. Well, what can I say, I like it! Especially the functions. After setting up a few functions and using it for about an hour or so, let me tell you,I'm never going back to any other shell ever again!(jk. I have to go back to bash once in a while because I'm fish noob and don't know how to properly write the fish compatible commands yet.) But seriously, I'm all in with fish and I have only scraped the surface yet I'm already impressed by how usable and feature rich it is. Highly recommended switching to fish. (first function or abbreviation you should setup is the cd functions to your most visited folders.)Next up, is the prompt. Nothing fancy there, just Homebrew Starship and did my own custom version of the Catppuccin Powerline preset (https://starship.rs/presets/catppuccin-powerline). You can try it out from here -https://github.com/hashangit/hashangit-starship-config. It's pretty, and fairly easy to customise with so many plug-in options also available to choose from. One thing I noticed is that you can't use the [git_branch], [git_status] plug-in to conditionally switch colour based on if the branch is in sync or out of sync. I would have loved to have it change to green if in sync with origin and yellow if not but, I couldn't find a way to do it. So I'm configured it to show changes vs show nothing using the [git_status] plug-in instead for now. (any feedback is welcome!)Alright, Let's get to the fun part!ContainerisationBazzite is an immutable Linux distro (more like built on top of an immutable Fedora but same difference). This is a good thing AND at the same time, it means you need a bit of extra attention when setting everything up. OS base being immutable is great and you should try your very best to keep it that way, for security as well as to prevent YOU, YOURSELF, out of ignorance, destroying your own os installation. Latter is the more important thing for someone like myself, who doesn't really know the ins and outs but learn by fiddling around. But you can gain system level access if you want, with rpm-ostree, but, so far, i haven't had the need to. Homebrew is available and it, as far as I understand, has separation already so it shouldn't affect the base os, meaning I, and also You can't destroy your system out of ignorance.So then how do you get things done in scenarios where you need system level access? Easy.SWITCH TO UBUNTU!No what I actually meant is, get an Ubuntu based container running on Distrobox and get your development enviornment setup there with your tools and dependencies. At this point, I'm sure the experts are just screaming out of their heads, telling me how wrong my approach is, and yes, I have the IDEs etc setup on my host and I have my runtimes and dependencies and and other tools setup in the container, and I'm exporting them out to the host. Is it the best way? perhaps not. Does it work just fine for my workflows? So far YES! without a hitch. So for now, this is perfectly fine as far as I'm concerned. You could have all your different projects isolated into their own individual containers including al the tools like IDEs etc but, I thought that is too much for my specific requirement. Ionly really work with JS, TS, python for NextJS, ExpressJS, NodeJS, React/ React Native, different python projects (all isolated with venv and potery) and that's about it for now so really, my requirements aren't too complex to warrant a more complex isolation approach per project. In fact, being able to use the same pnpm store across project, helps a lot in my case as I have a metered internet connection. I can write up a guide based on how I did my setup IF enough people need me to but, to be honest, getting Claude to write a custom guide for your specific scenario would be the better approach (which is what I did. I had no clue whatsoever on what I'm suppose to do in the first place when I thought of switching to Bazzite)That brings me to the next important thing in my list.Claude Desktop2. Getting Claude Desktop with MCP support to work on BazziteTruth be told, I am no expert in this. I mean I am an expert in USING Claude but not in terms of turning an electron windows app into a Linux app. So all the credit should go to the original developer on making it a really simple painless process to get Claude Desktop working with MCP supportON UBUNTU!. Alright, I'm sure you can see where I'm going with this. Just install it into the ubuntu container and export the app out to the host just like we did with pnpm, node, etc.. it just works and the instructions are so very clear and simple.Thank YouEsmiand Thank YouAaddrickHere's the link to the repo that I used:https://github.com/emsi/claude-desktop/tree/mainHere's the link to the original repo which the above one is based on:https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian3. Adobe Illustrator on LinuxApparently, this is not possible and Adobe doesn't seem to have any real intention to bring Adobe suite to Linux, at all, ever. So that's that! Honestly, I use Illustrator quite rarely as of late in my workflows (Thank You Canva) so this is nota major blocker for me anymore. I have 3 options available. I can use Illustrator on my MacBook or, I can temporarily switch to my old Windows installation for just that or I can run Windows on a VM on Bazzite and run Illustrator on that. Honestly, using Ilustrator on my MacBook is the easiest, most painless route so yeah, I don't think I'm going to bother with 'Adobe on Linux' battle.4. World of Warcraft Retail on LinuxNow, here's the funny thing. WoW Windows game works better on Linux compared to Windows! 🫳🏽🎤 Setting up is quite simple. The route that worked for me out of the box with no issues, is Lutris route. Bazzite comes with Lutris pre-installed. Just search forBattle.netin Lutris and install. But first, you gotta do a couple of small things.Get ProtonPlus via BazaarOn ProtonPlus, switch to Lutris from Steam on the top left corner. Scroll down to Wine, and download 'Wine-Staging-Tkg (Kron4ek)'. Anything after v10.6 works apparently and I'm using v10.12 which works in August 2025 (before retail 11.2 patch. PTR 11.2 works so no reason why 11.2 shouldn't work).Next, on Lutris, Preferences > Runners > Wine > runner Options > Wine Version and seect the newly downloaded version. Alternatively, if you have already downloadedBattle.net, you can right click, Configure > Runner Options > Wine Version and select the latest version you just downloaded. You can double-check to see if DXVK and VKD3D are enabled because you need to have those enabled.Now you can go ahead and run Battle.net. Just make sure to read what the wizaed says and do as mentioned. You want it to download the Battle.net Update Agent then run it and go all the way until the login window is presented.DON NOT LOGIN RIGHT NOW!Let's Lutris finish the installation properly.Once Lutris completes the full installation, then you can launchBattle.netand login.Now, if you are coming from Windows, and already have your game files on Windows, and don't want to download the game files again, well, you are in luck! but, you need to first do a couple of things. You need to log into your windows installation (probably for the last time in your life) and turn off 'Fast Start Up' which you may need to do through Powershell now because the control Panel and Settings aren't showing the option anymore (at least in my case) and turn off any other settings that cause the ntfs-3g driver on Linux to prevent you from mouting the Windows installation with full read / write permissions (a simple Google search can give you all the information you need on this.). This is required if your WoW game files are saved on the same drive as your Windows installation.Now, Bazite should be able to easily mount the NTFS drive with your WoW game files and you can just do this via Dolphin (file browser) itsel. (Remember to double-check if its mounted with out and write restrictions). Now its just a matter of updating the game files folder onBattle.netclient just like you normally would on Windows and point to the game files folder on the NTFS partition. This works just fine without any issues whatsoever. But the recommended way is to copy the game files folder onto your btrfs drive for best perfomance. But, personally, I'd keep it as is, just in case, if WoW has issues on Bazzite (unlikely) for some reason (even Blizzard has confirmed that while they don't officially support Linux, they would not intentionally break it either.)Launch the game and start your adventures in Azeroth and K'aresh from where you left off! (Or in Outland. Your choice. I'm not judging.)5. Office 365 on Linux.Outright, this doesn't work. But its the same story like the Adobe Illustrator. Google workspace EXISTS! And the Office 365 broswer version is adequate in most cases. If strictly need Office 365, I can use it on my MacBook, or switch to Windows for a it temporarily. Also, from my experience, Libre Office applications are more than capable and is a decent user experience unless you strictly want the Microsoft vesion for some strange reason. So this is not and issue, at least for me.6. The multimedia experienceSimple answer is, Bazzite multimedia experience (atealst in my case) isFantastic!I tried out Ubuntu 25.04 when it came out, on my Desktop, and the audio quality was bad and it sounded tinny and no bass. On Windows, since I'm using a bluetooth speaker, there's a delay between the video and audio which completely destroys the media experience. On Bazzite though, I have no such issues. Audio is deep and rich with proper bass and while i have not yet gotten to it, there are easy to use system-wide EQ tools to tune it up to your exact preference. My Speakers have SBC codec and Bazzit is correctly picking and using the SBC codec for best possible output. I have a dual 2k + 1080p monitor setup. While they are not high refresh rate monitors, I'm not seeing anything wrong with the visual experience compared to what I see on Windows and when i connect my MacBook to the same monitors. Onething I've noticed is that the default setting is to let the monitor manage the colour accuracy so if you have 2 different monitors (especially 2 different brands and 2 different panel tech like mine with HP and Samsung) you'll see the same thing in different colours. This for me is acceptable and i think depending on your monitor's capabilities, you might be able to make them lookalike with a bit a tweaking in the display configuration.So, should you switch to Bazzite?YES. It's better than Windowssubmitted by/u/Designer_Athlete7286[link][comments]</div>

Every few years, someone declares the end of moviegoing. First it was cable, then VHS, then DVDs, streaming, and even COVID. And yet — the big screen persists.

Sure, the landscape has changed. Since 2019, the U.S. has lost nearly 5,000 movie theater screens. Big chains have struggled financially. Alamo Drafthouse, once independent, was recently acquired by Sony Pictures. And Netflix’s Ted Sarandos famously claimed that moviegoing is an “outdated concept.”

But people still love going to the movies — and independent movie theater owners are meeting that passion head-on.

Across the country, independent cinemas are reimagining what it means to be a theater. From inventive programming and community events to affordable tickets and local partnerships, they’re creating experiences that go far beyond just watching a film.

We sat down with Emelyn Stuart (Stuart Cinema), Matthew Viragh (Nitehawk Cinemas), and Thaddeus Bouchard (Screendollars) to explore how these theaters are thriving — and why the industry isn’t on life support just yet.

No other issues.This probobly changed when I used rpm-ostree rollback. I wasn t able to load bazzite it would just freeze like for 3 times in a row than it loaded. I thought an update broke my system since the previous ostree 1 worked fine for a while. But the issue persisted and eventually appearing in windows aswell it ended up being a bad displayport cable.Should i just ignore the number disappearing ?submitted by/u/Mario2x2SK[link][comments]</div>

Making dual boot basically infeasible if you need DKMS modules on your Linux. You'd need to manually sign everything which is a total pain in the ass... I've heard nobody talking about that yet. Even dual-boot will be unfeasible!!submitted by/u/Wrong-Historian[link][comments]</div>

But that was just the beginning of his hacking career. When he stumbled into the terrifying (and perfectly legal) world of data brokers, he built a pipeline for identity theft on a massive scale.

But why are these companies even allowed to exist? And who are they selling all our personal data to, anyway? What Hieu uncovered might change how your look at the world.

"i refuse to boot windows no matter how much of an inconvenience it is." So many of these people are just incoherent and just scream 'use linux' regardless of anyones scenario. you need adobe? 'youre an idiot use something else open source, who cares if its good or fits your needs'. I really want to play Fortnite or BF6. 'you are so dumb for playing a game thats not supported on linux.' you know what? its OK to use Windows. life is too short and putting up some sort of wild stance about an operating system is so insanely stupid. and everyone who tries to force someone one way or another for an operating system? needs to re-evaluate their life choices.Use whatever operating system youd like to play the games you want to play.99% of everyone crying about microsoft and their privacy are using gmail, google search, reddit, X. ALL of these are just as intrusive or more to your privacy.oh you dont like microsoft controlling your patching and reboots? all you CachyOs or any Arch people need to patch and reboot way more often than windows makes you reboot or your system will break.look. im a more often than not a linux user/gamer but its OK to use windows. i use it for VR cause its just better all around 100%. if i feel the need to play BR6, ill just boot Windows if i feel like it. it doesnt need to be this boycott cause in the end, its only harming you. this will not change the narrativesubmitted by/u/typhon88[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-378" class="summary" style="display: none;">More than 50 Texas House Democrats left the state Sunday, one day after a bill that would dramatically redraw Texas’ congressional maps passed a state legislative committee in the GOP-led House of Representatives.
The Texas House requires 100 members be present to conduct business, and the House only includes 88 Republicans. The Democrats’ action, known as “breaking quorum,” effectively brings the House to a standstill and prevents any consideration of the bill by the full chamber.

The heavily redrawn congressional maps, which are backed by President Trump, could give Republicans five extra seats in the midterm elections. House Democratic Caucus Chair Gene Wu spoke in a Chicago suburb, flanked by fellow House Democrats and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker.

“If Donald Trump is allowed to do this, if he is allowed to, once again, cheat and get away with it, there is no stopping this. This will spread across the country.”

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said that if those Democrats who have broken quorum do not return to the Capitol immediately, he will invoke a ruling by state Attorney General Ken Paxton to have them expelled from the Texas House.</div>

<div id="summary-382" class="summary" style="display: none;">Just had one of those infuriating "WTF, Microsoft?" moments. We run a production mail system through Azure Communication Services (ACS) Email, which, as documented (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/email/email-overview), is completely separate from Exchange Online. It’s an authenticated mail service using App Registrations, no connectors, no direct send, no relation to EXO transport pipeline at all.So what happens when we (responsibly) enable RejectDirectSend in Exchange Online to harden domain spoofing protections?Mail flow from ACS Email dies.Not a hiccup. Not a delay. A full-on "message rejected" scenario as if we were doing unauthenticated direct send, which we're not.Open a case with Microsoft support, and I get a politely worded, totally useless response that boils down to:"Yeah that’s expected. Direct Send from accepted domains gets blocked when you flip the switch. Configure a connector or disable it."WHAT CONNECTOR? What are you even talking about?!ACS Email is not an Exchange Online workload. It authenticates through Azure, not Exchange. It doesn’t use direct send, and there’s no way to configure a connector for it in Exchange Online, nor should there be. This is literally Microsoft breaking their own mail platform with another Microsoft product’s security feature.How do you even QA this kind of thing?So now we’re in a position where a global mail solution billed as enterprise-grade and scalable for apps/services is dependent on Exchange Online not having one specific setting enabled, a setting that’s there to prevent spoofing.Let me say that again: a security feature in EXO breaks Microsoft’s own separate, authenticated, app-to-email service.The cherry on top: Support telling us to “configure a partner connector” and “check SPF.” As if this were a traditional SMTP relay scenario.No. This is a secure, authenticated service designed for cloud-first applications. You broke it by accident, and the response is basically, "Oops, sorry."This is the kind of crap that makes IT pros want to jump ship and go live in the woods.Microsoft: Either separate your services properly or document the fact that internal product lines can silently brick each other.And no, I will not be “temporarily disabling” domain spoofing protections because you couldn’t design your systems to talk to each other.Unacceptablesubmitted by/u/Intrepid_Chard_3535[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-383" class="summary" style="display: none;">In case you haven't already heard, EA has decided to actively block Proton, Wine or SteamDeck from running their brand new shooter, as they have already done for other titles of the saga, such as BF1.After the Windows 11 debacle and many users quitting Windows seemingly forever after being forced to buy new hardware to feed Bill Gates' already full pockets. it would be a step back for everyone in the Linux community and otherwise to simply roll over and take it up the ass when it comes to this new occurrence.I've already heard people in other subreddits pushing users to dual-boot what is essentially spy- and ad-ware on their machines, because there will be no other way to play this game, not only because EA and DICE are incompetent enough to produce anticheat that support Proton (much like EasyAntiCheat has been able to do forever) but also because they outright don't give a fuck about us users.I don't only refer to Linux users in the previous sentence, but to every single user of a PC anywhere in the world. What do EA care if you choose to play their brand spanking new game that costs 70 bucks on any hardware of your choosing? Why require SecureBoot to run the game? Are they that incompetent? Yes, but not only that, as I've already said! They simply don't give a fuck about consumers, and just want to make a quick buck out of you!We must all rise to the occasion by boycotting this game to show this company that their extortion techniques will be met with nothing less than outright war.Thank you very much for coming to my TED talk.EDIT:I'm told Bill Gates only owns 1% of Microsoft now. I extend my deeply felt hatred to all corpos running that particular company and all others that seek to destroy consumers in their endless greed. This includes, of course, Nvidia for refusing to collaborate in making open-source drivers for their cards unlike what AMD has been able to do.EDIT 2:Since I keep on seeing some points repeated over and over in the comment section, I would like to clarify my position on these.I didn't expect this post to have that much impact in the general PC community anyway. It was meant more as a reflection into how giving up on Windows after the Windows 11 debacle and then going back to dual-booting might not be an option for some users given they might not be unable to install Windows 11 at all, which is a kick in the face for consumers.There are (at least) two big camps of people in the comment section. One part says "LOL just dual boot". Again, this might not be an option for some people, and even if it is, it's a kick in the face to have to do so.Another camp says "is it really a boycott if Linux doesn't support it so we can't install it?" I know, that's the point behind the post, the idea of reinstalling Windows (if you are able to do so) just to play this game is stupid in my eyes, hence I made this rant post. Some people might feel inclined to do so, and I wanted to give them a counterargument against that decision.Once again, I don't expect 4% of the PC playerbase "boycotting" (or simply not being able to install) this game to have any impact, of course not, but it doesn't personally feel right to pay 70 bucks for a game I can't run on my machine unless I use what has turned out to be adware and spyware. It doesn't feel right to support outright incompetence/malice by giving them my money so they can run code within my computer's kernel because they can't / don't care enough to come up with a better solution. I know I'm preaching to the converted, just wanted to voice my opinion and reasoning once again.EDIT 3:To anyone thinking I'm somehow forcing people to boycott this game or do anything at all, I have no power over anyone, especially over the Internet, since I'm no Jedi. You sure better contact the Council if you think you have the ability to do so, but that ain't me. I also have no intention of turning "this" (this subreddit? this Linux community? I really don't know...) into a religion or a cult by imposing my views, as some commenters have stated.To everyone: kindly do whatever you want, I'm not holding you at gunpoint, I just wanted to voice my take.submitted by/u/ChemiCalChems[link][comments]</div>

In this soulful Toronto apartment tour, Lisa invites us into her colorful and story-rich home located in the heart of the city. Opting for the character of an older building over a modern condo, Lisa has crafted a space that functions as a personal art gallery, championing the work of Black, POC, and local Toronto artists. This home is a stunning example of intentional maximalism, where every object and art piece is chosen with purpose and tells a part of her story.

The tour begins in a welcoming entryway featuring vibrant art celebrating Black girlhood, setting the tone for a home filled with identity and pride. From a tiny bathroom with unique vintage flooring to a cozy bedroom built around a cherished antique nightstand, personal history is woven into the fabric of the decor. The living room is the apartment's centerpiece, featuring a stunning gallery wall with works by artists like Mark Stoddart and Attos Setu, each piece holding deep significance. Across the room, colorful paintings by Kalkidan Assefa and Quinton Versetti bring the vibrancy of Toronto inside.

Beyond the art, this tour is packed with inspiration for small space living. See how Lisa created a dedicated dining nook, uses a bookcase to display her love for literature (spines out!), and seamlessly integrates her cat's needs with stylish, functional furniture. From her views on displaying family photos to her love for the nostalgia of fridge magnets and memories of Honest Ed's, Lisa's tour is more than just interior design. It's a lesson in how to build a home that is a sanctuary of personal expression, community, and heritage.

<div id="summary-395" class="summary" style="display: none;">I have a question: How many ants would it take to lift a person? We asked experts!

Let’s assume we use the world’s strongest ant, the leaf cutter ant...

The answer is a surprisingly small number of ants, considering a leaf cutter colony can have over 8 million.

BUT you probably wont get kidnapped by ants any time soon.

<div id="summary-406" class="summary" style="display: none;">A new, gigantic Direct sees John, Rich and Oliver mull over what might be next generation Xbox silicon, bringing together consumer CPU and GPU parts into custom APUs that could genuinely shake up the PC market. The team react to the excellent-looking Battlefield 6 reveal, while there's a mixed reception to the latest Nintendo Direct. Meanwhile, John raves about a brand new Genesis/Mega Drive game from an industry legend while Oliver and Rich are staggered at the concept of AMD's huge Strix Halo APU slated to appear in not one but two gaming handhelds.

From the updated visuals and enemy design to the massive overhaul of soupers and abilities, to the tone and structure, this might be the spiritual reboot Destiny has needed. Here's a breakdown of what stood out, what NetEase got right, and what this means for the future of the franchise.

When a titan music mogul (Denzel Washington), widely known as having the “best ears in the business,” is targeted with a ransom plot, he is jammed up in a life-or-death moral dilemma.

In 2025, cybersecurity has entered “AI vs AI, episode one.” In this conversation, we discuss why attackers currently have the advantage, how AI hacking agents can bypass scraping defences and anti-scraper tooling, and why zero-click style attacks against key infrastructure are an emerging risk. We also outline the defender’s path to shift the balance back, and why this race won’t stop.

<div id="summary-421" class="summary" style="display: none;">Guys, if you're going to run docker on an enterprise environment, talk to your network folks. Don't just pick a non default IP space because you think the default will cause problems.Network guy here, we carved out the default 172.16.0.0/16 space for you to do what you will in your private docker instances. We will never make an enterprise network in this space. But you went and changed your docker IP scheme to 172.60.0.0/16 and black-holed a whole building from being able to use your application. Why would you do that? This is the only docker network running on this machine, there was genuinely no reason to change it.Now I have users that are complaining and blaming network when an application guy decided to change default for the sake of changing default.Edit: 172.60.0.0/16 is just a random IP I pulled out of my ass. We're not actually using it.submitted by/u/nick99990[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-424" class="summary" style="display: none;">The internet was supposed to set us free. But somewhere along the way, it became a tool for surveillance, extraction, and control. What happened? And is there still time to reclaim the weird, untapped potential of the digital world?

This week, Sean is joined by Douglas Rushkoff. He’s a media theorist, author of Survival of the Richest and Team Human, and host of the Team Human podcast. They trace the arc of the internet from its utopian beginnings to its corporate capture, and explore what it would take to build something different. Along the way, they talk about the loss of weirdness, the logic of capitalism, the dangers of scale, and the difference between systems thinking and systems feeling. They also reflect on whether it’s still possible to use technology to foster a more connected and communal life.

I think this violates the community rules, as this isn’t an outside troubleshooting forum; it’s a forum of Systems Administrators helping each other out, complaining about our jobs, and just anything we all go through. With all of the IT cuts and AI push, I don’t think this should be the forum that allows this. Also, it should be fairly obvious who doesn’t know the IT basics and just had some meetings to find out enough to seem to know what they’re talking about.submitted by/u/iwantdatgold[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-449" class="summary" style="display: none;">This homestead includes two handcrafted natural homes, a geodesic dome greenhouse built from local stone, a hand-dug stream, two natural swimming ponds, a bamboo maze, and a thriving permaculture garden and orchard with over 2,000 plants. It’s a place where the home doesn’t just shelter you—it feeds you, cools and heats itself, filters your air, and invites you to slow down and live well.

It’s the work of Vicente Nadal, a pioneer in natural building in his part of Spain, País Valencià. Tucked away in a quiet canyon near Alicante—just beyond the bustle of the Mediterranean coast— he’s blending ancient building knowledge with smart, low-tech innovation. Vicente believes the future lies in remembering what we've forgotten: using local materials, designing with the climate, and creating homes that actually give back.

Here, nearly everything is made from stone, lime, and wood found on the land. The main house—once a plain stucco structure—is now full of organic curves and warmth, with thick walls that insulate and sculpted heated benches built into the design. The smaller home features a clever modular wall system that converts the open-plan studio into a two-bedroom layout in seconds. The dome greenhouse is not only functional, but striking—built by hand with lime mortar and wood for growing food year-round.

Vicente designs homes that blend with nature and are health-enhancing. He uses lime plasters and paints inside and out, which naturally absorb CO₂, filter indoor air, and resist mold and bacteria. For cooling, a DIY “Canadian Well” system (AKA earth-coupled air cooling system) brings in fresh air from underground. For heating, thermal inertia stoves made with natural materials release warmth slowly over 24 hours using minimal wood—heating both the space and the built-in seating with efficiency and beauty.

The land is shaped to support water and life: a meandering stream crosses under a stone Roman-style bridge, feeding two deep, natural ponds that help filter water and provide a habitat for frogs, dragonflies, and fish. There’s even an outdoor limestone shower that, four years on, still looks like new—thanks to limestone’s natural resistance to stains and microbes.

Even the finishing touches are rooted in local wisdom. Esparto blinds hang on the outside of windows, blocking harsh summer sun while letting in dappled light—and on hot days, they can be misted to cool the air that enters the home. A treehouse built from leftover wood and salvaged windows, a mountain bike trail, and winding paths through the orchard show how joy, play, and function all coexist here. 

For Vicente, this kind of building isn’t a niche lifestyle—it’s a return to sanity. When you treat your home as an ecosystem, it becomes something that supports your health, grows your food, powers your comfort, and connects you to the land.

<div id="summary-458" class="summary" style="display: none;">Alex and Al started off as friends who decided to help each other build their own separate tiny homes, side by side.  But by the time their tiny home walls were framed, they had fallen in love.  So, they decided to build one of the tiny homes for them both to live in, and they finished and sold the other tiny house to help cover some of their expenses.  They’ve been together for almost 6 years now and just recently got married!  They are still living in the tiny house together and say that it is even better than they hoped it would be!

Their tiny house was built on a 24’ long trailer, and it has 2’ bump outs at each end, bringing the total length to 28’.  The width is 8.5’, and the height is 13.5’.  The trailer they used is from Iron Eagle, and they chose it because the floor of the trailer is sunken down which provides some much needed vertical inches to make sure they had enough head room on the main floor and up in the loft.

Alex and Al tried to use as many reclaimed and local materials as possible to reduce waste on the project, including using salvaged cedar shingles and planks for their siding, flooring from an old bowling alley, and locally milled wood.  For their interior walls, they used Wedi board and plastered it with venetian plaster for a stunning finish.

Storage and space to cook were two major priorities with their design, so they have 38 large drawers to make sure they can keep the tiny space organized, and they have loads of counter space in the galley kitchen for preparing large meals and canning preserves.

Alex and Al heat their tiny home with wood, and they made sure to get their wood stove WETT certified.  Another thing they did to help make sure they could get home insurance was to skirt their tiny home and remove the wheels.  By doing this, they were able to get mobile home insurance which was cheaper than tiny house insurance.

Their covered porch almost doubles their living space and was built using glass from secondhand sliding doors, and driftwood posts from a nearby beach.  The deck itself is built in sections so that it can be taken apart and moved if they have to find a new location.

Finding parking for the tiny house was challenging and the couple is currently at their third location.  The first was an old covered mill where they began their build, but were evicted along with the other folks on the land.  The second was a nice forested site but it did not have any services so it was only used to complete their build.  Their third parking spot was found by putting up posters in the neighbourhoods where they wanted to live.  It has water, electricity, and septic, and they only had to bring in their own internet.  

The land rent is more affordable than renting an apartment or home in their area, and they also contribute to the landlords in other ways like chopping their firewood.

Just constantly checking the frames. Even after I bought one of the first GSYNC module monitors back in the day, I was using fraps to look at frames. When it dropped to 40fps I used to think man this sucks...Now that I've built a bazzite machine, I have 0 clue on how to install fraps or look at the performance frames and I've been testing a few games out only to notice that frames really don't matter all that much to me anymore. I know some games are going from 130fps and dropping down to 70fps and even 40fps in some scenes but guess what? I don't feel it, I can't see it, I don't notice it and all I notice is the games story and the graphics.In the past, I constantly had my eye on the top right hand corner every other second lol and when it dipped to 40, I could feel it because my eyes saw 40 fps. Now when I play games at 1080p with a resolution modifier of 4k, i know there is no way my comp is maintaining 100fps+ and it has to be dipping to 40fps but the great thing is, I don't notice it or feel it because of the VRR.submitted by/u/Unhappywageslave[link][comments]",

    "summary": "Hey folks,I\u2019m still kinda new to Linux, so please be gentle. I first discovered it about a year ago thanks to my Steam Deck, and for the past few months I\u2019ve been using desktop mode as my main PC. 15 years ago I used also Ubuntu for a while.At first, I was honestly impressed with how much I could do right out of the box. But it didn\u2019t take long to run into situations where you have to use the terminal to get certain things working.A couple of examples:GNOME Boxes (VM for Windows) \u2014 Bluetooth passthrough only works if you install it through the terminal.I use a European cloud provider instead of Google Drive, but their client is only available as an AppImage. Personally, I find AppImage distribution a bit frustrating, you have to manually update the app by downloading the new file each time, and it doesn\u2019t integrate into the system like a regular installed program. And yes, I know there are tools like Gearlever (and similar) that can help manage AppImages, but it still feels clunky compared to other installation methodsSo here are my questions:If the dream is for Linux (and open source in general) to go mainstream, why are there so many different app distribution methods?Why isn\u2019t one distro out there that\u2019s truly hassle-free? My father (70+ yo) who can currently understand and use windows, will not be able to use and understand Linux. Is it technically not possible to create a distro which is straight forward like windows and MacOS?Also, about Bazzite: I get that it\u2019s marketed to gamers and comes with Heroic Launcher, Lutris, and Steam preinstalled, but aside from that, it still feels just as complicated (for not tech savvy peaple) as every other distro I\u2019ve tried or heard and read about. I don\u2019t really get why it\u2019s praised as \u201chassle-free.\u201dOne last thing: When people say a distro is \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad,\u201d most of the time they\u2019re actually talking about the desktop environment or UI, not the distro itself. Am I understanding that right?Curious to hear what you all think.submitted by/u/Harvy784[link][comments]",

Overall the job is great and management and coworkers are really nice, even guy and I get along and joke, but he is just endlessly incompetent.Earlier this week we had a new hire start. I let guy set up their computer ahead of time and specifically told him to join it to the domain and not do the company portal join method (something we have gone through numerous times). New hire mentions that they aren't getting a prompt to reset their password, and I instantly know that guy did not listen to me AGAIN and decided to do it his way despite him having already dealt with this exact issue previously. So I just fixed it.I explained our user accounts are local to the DC and he needs to do hybrid join or else many things won't work. He then says \"oh I should probably do that for all the other PCs that I just deployed\". Yes it was his project to replace our old devices (windows 10 EOL prep).THIS IS WHERE IT GETS REALLY BAD.Yesterday he mentions to me that the Microsoft secure score recommends that we make all of our devices hybrid. I quote \"so if I make all of the devices hybrid, our secure score will go up!\". I explained again what hybrid is and how we are already primarily hybrid.WAIT IT GETS WORSE!Today he goes \"Microsoft says I can increase our secure score if I disable all of the cookies on edge browsers\".Even typing this it sounds fake Jesus Christ.I'm explaining that we can't disable all cookies and he's saying we can and another coworker (who is not in IT, cause again it's just us two) explains cookies to him and why we can't block them all. He is still on the fence but relents after I repeatedly tell him not to and say \"ok do it, but I'm not saving you from (our boss) this time.\"I really wish I was rage baiting or karma farming but I just fucking can't dude it's been over a year and a half and guy still can't remember to fucking domain join our desktops.I talked to my manager tonight. The cookie thing was really just too much. Manager almost had a panic attack before I told him I stopped guy. Manager said he's gonna have a chat with guy but I really don't know how you would deal with that.

    "summary": "My goal for these posts are simple: people should be able to enjoy the games they legitimately own in whatever computing environment they prefer. Be it for security isolation, OS preference, or hardware constraints.Disclaimer: This post is purely educational and explores the technical mechanisms behind CPU timing detection. I am not encouraging anyone to bypass anti-cheat systems. Attempting to circumvent these protections typically results in being kicked from games when caught but they may change their tune at any-point and thus result in account bans. This information is provided to help people understand the technical challenges of VM gaming and the reality that many games can indeed run in virtual machines despite common misconceptions.The \"Impossible\" VM Gaming MythFollowing myprevious article on EA Javelin, I received numerous replies both here and elsewhere claiming that games with RDTSC timing checks simply \"cannot run in VMs\" or \"results in immediate bans\" and that virtualization is fundamentally incompatible with modern anti-cheat systems.This isn't true.While challenging, the technical barriers can be understood and, addressed without reprocussions.What Are RDTSC Timing Checks?RDTSC (Read Time Stamp Counter) timing checks are one of the most sophisticated VM detection methods used by modern games. Unlike simple CPUID checks that look for hypervisor signatures, timing checks measure the actualperformance characteristicsof CPU instructions to detect virtualization overhead.The Detection MechanismHere's the actual code pattern that games like those using BattlEye and Easy Anti-Cheat employ:static inline unsigned long long rdtsc_diff_vmexit() { unsigned long long ret, ret2; unsigned eax, edx; // Get initial timestamp __asm__ volatile(\"rdtsc\" : \"=a\" (eax), \"=d\" (edx)); ret = ((unsigned long long)eax) | (((unsigned long long)edx) << 32); // Run an instruction that will cause the VM to have to pass back to the host CPU natively. CPUID is an example of this __asm__ volatile(\"cpuid\" : /* no output */ : \"a\"(0x00)); // Get timestamp after VM exit __asm__ volatile(\"rdtsc\" : \"=a\" (eax), \"=d\" (edx)); ret2 = ((unsigned long long)eax) | (((unsigned long long)edx) << 32); return ret2 - ret; } int detect_virtualization() { unsigned long long avg = 0; // Run test multiple times for accuracy (10 times in this example) for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) { avg += rdtsc_diff_vmexit(); Sleep(500); } avg = avg / 10; // Real hardware: <750 cycles, VM: 1200+ cycles return (avg < 750 && avg > 0) ? 0 : 1; }Why This WorksOn Real Hardware:CPUID executes natively in ~50-200 CPU cycles (This range is to accommodate for different CPUs)Timing is consistent and predictableAverage difference stays well under 750 cycles which they use as a bar to flag VMs.In Virtual Machines:CPUID causes expensive VM exit (guest \u2192 hypervisor transition)KVM must process the CPUID instruction in host contextVM exit + processing + VM entry overhead:1,200-2,000+ cyclesThe timing difference immediately reveals virtualizationThis is fundamentally different from hiding CPU vendor strings or disabling hypervisor CPUID bits. As those are flat commands, this is a dynamic, runtime check I.e it's measuring the actualcomputational overheadthat virtualization creates.A Working Solution: kvm-rdtsc-hackWhile I won't detail how to bypass EA's Javelin anti-cheat specifically (and this will not work on it anyways), there are legitimate tools for addressing RDTSC timing detection in general VM scenarios.Thekvm-rdtsc-hackkernel module by h33p provides a working solution for many RDTSC-based detection systems that use the CPUID has the testing method.(NOTE THIS IS BECOMING LESS AND LESS COMMON):# Clone and build the module git clone https://github.com/h33p/kvm-rdtsc-hack cd kvm-rdtsc-hack make # Load with appropriate timing offset sudo insmod kvm-rdtsc-hack.ko constant_tsc_offset=1600With the module does is intercepts KVM's RDTSC handling and provides fake timing values:// Core logic from the actual module source static void vcpu_pre_run(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu) { u64 cur_tsc, off, tsc_offset, new_tsc_offset; struct vcpu_offset_info *off_info; tsc_offset = vcpu->arch.l1_tsc_offset; off_info = get_cpu_offset_info(vcpu); if (off_info->called_cpuid) { // Calculate fake timing to mimic real hardware cur_tsc = rdtsc(); off = -kvm_scale_tsc(vcpu, constant_tsc_offset + cur_tsc - off_info->vmexit_tsc); new_tsc_offset += off; off_info->temp_offset += off; } // Apply the fake offset to make VM exits appear faster if (tsc_offset ^ new_tsc_offset) vcpu->arch.tsc_offset = kvm_x86_ops.write_l1_tsc_offset(vcpu, new_tsc_offset); }Key Insight:Instead of trying to make VM exits faster (hard to do but a better approach), it manipulates the TSC values that the guest sees, making VM exitsappearto take only ~200-400 cycles instead of the real 1,200+ cycles.Timing Offset Values:When setting your timing remember that Higher values = lower apparent timing, but risk backwards time progression as such on average you want to set it appropriately for your CPU:Intel systems: typically 1000-1200AMD Ryzen: typically 1400-1800Testing Your Setup:# Use pafish or similar detection tool ./pafish # Should show: [PASS] RDTSC VM exit timing checkLimitations and Reality CheckThis Approach Has LimitsEA Javelin: Uses additional detection vectors beyond RDTSC checks that this method doesn't addressPerformance Impact: RDTSC interception adds measurable overhead (~2-5%)Maintenance: Kernel modules need updates for new kernel versionsEA's Javelin anti-cheat implements multiple detection layers so this alone would never work:RDTSC timing checks(what this method addresses)Hardware performance counter analysisvia APERF/MPERF MSRsCache timing attacksmeasuring L1/L2/L3 cache access patternsMemory access pattern detectionfor VM memory management signaturesSystem call timing analysismeasuring syscall overhead differencesThe kvm-rdtsc-hack module only addresses layer 1. EA Javelin's additional detection vectors remain unaffected, which is why this specific approach doesn't work against current EA titles.submitted by/u/KstrlWorks[link][comments]",

I don't particularly like the Outlook client, I think as a general rule that it's pretty bad at a simple task. But how worse can a new software made by a multi billion dollar company can be ?Much worse.I work for a quite large law firm and they have strict requirements for about everything. This week, I started working on a way to strictly control how we deploy signatures.At first, I explored Exclaimer and CodeTwo, but both demand that we reroute all mails to them for maximum control, which is a no no for our line of business. So I thought \"How hard can it be to powershell my way out of it ?\"Turns out, with Outlook classic, it's fairly easy. After two days work, I automated about everything you can think of, from deploying multiple languages, so conditionnally inserting the lawyer's title / rank / diploma, generating a vcar with a picture encoded, dynamically linking the lawyer's linkedin and website profile, and so on.And believe it or not, it even sync'd to the new outlook / web outlook. Just not quite the correct display, just a few tweaks and... no.There is basically zero customization you can do in this Outlook version. You can pick line spacing, it automatically underlines links even if you disable or explicitly disable underline on links (it comes back later), spaces are randomly trimmed...I paused for a moment and took a moment to look at how the New Outlook worked, and it dawned on me : it lacks at least 80% of the original client's functionalities, but even worse, they are hidden behind icons instead of text buttons wich makes finding the think you're looking for much harder.At this point, I am contemplating the possibility of switching to another client such as Thunderbird.With Microsoft, everything gets worse every year. The only thing I like that was added in the past 5 years or so was the whole SSO ecosystem which is probably the main selling point to me. I just wish the main tool I'm working on wasn't on a path of complete enshittification.submitted by/u/Alzzary[link][comments]",

I hope this post doesn't break any rules...I wrote my own cross-platform game launcher (I know, what a unique project /s).Since I am a Linux user and according to Steam did 90% of my gaming in 2024 under Linux, I have naturally been developing this with Linux as a focus, and not only Windows. It is currently in what I would call a proof-of-concept state. There will some weird and broken behavior, but I hope you can find some value in it while it's being developed.The video is a showcase of the launcher running what would be a fresh installation.Some of the main selling points are:Light weight: Low resource usageQuick: Launches practically instantly compared to \"competition\"Cross-platform: Compiles for Windows, MacOS and Linux. Currently only developing features for Windows and Linux.Working on supporting games acrossmultiple stores.Open SourceAttempts to beprivacy preservingandsecureCommunity driven: You can get your voice heard and let me know what you want to see more of in the future.I'm going to keep this brief so that I don't bore anyone to sleep. I'm currently looking for help in developing this project. Anyone who is interested in contributing in any way, shape, or form is welcome to DM me.What I specifically need the most help with is web development (I am not a web developer). The launcher is written with a Rust backend but a (partially vibe-coded) React UI using Tauri. But anyone who would like to help with docs, Rust, UI/UX, infrastructure, security, you name it... is of course welcome.If you don't want to or know how to contribute you can simply use it if you want to and let me know what you think :)Link to website:https://monarch-launcher.com/Link to project on GitHub:https://github.com/Monarch-Launcher/Monarchsubmitted by/u/An0nymooze[link][comments]",

The revamped layout introduces bold statement elements like a bright blue metallic staircase that appears to float between levels and a custom-built bookshelf inspired by Swiss graphic design. Stainless steel kitchen cabinetry is softened by sunrise-inspired curves and bright blue 3D-printed knobs, while concrete floors ground the whimsical elements. Authi\u00e9 designed and built much of the furniture himself\u2014from animal-shaped chairs and spiked rosebush-inspired coffee tables to cactus-like lamps. Upstairs, a new walk-in wardrobe, a soft grey bed with integrated storage, and a bathroom clad in lush green tiles channel the vibe of a tropical greenhouse.\n\n00:00-01:24 Introduction\n01:24-03:17 Floor Plan\n03:17-03:35 Location\n03:35-03:51 Entrance\n03:51-05:20 Kitchen\n05:20-07:08 Living Room\n07:08-08:13 Bedroom\n08:13-09:16 Bathroom\n09:16-09:50 Conclusion\n\nRead the full article about this apartment here: https://www.nevertoosmall.com/post/paris-home-balancing-brutalism-and-cartooncore  \n\nImages featured in the episode: \n00:49 Orange Farm by Zyva Studio.

But you must not believe her. Maxwell was the right-hand woman of Jeffrey Epstein to whom she was a girlfriend as well as a top manager of Epstein\u2019s clandestine trafficking operation.\n\nNow Maxwell is begging the Supreme Court, the Congress as well as the President of the United States to get her conviction overturned, get clemency or an outright pardon. \n\nThis would be a disastrous blow to the criminal justice system as well as a major disservice to the dozens of victims Maxwell was found guilty of abusing along with Epstein. \n\nBut the worst part of this is that some conservative commentators are now claiming that Maxwell might be trusted to tell the truth and they are regurgitating her new line of defense \u2013 that she wasn\u2019t a co-conspirator in Epstein\u2019s criminal enterprise \u2013 but that she was his victim.

We talk about the lost joy of doing one thing at a time, the value of being bored, and how simple habits\u2014like listening to an album start to finish or playing a game without a second screen\u2014can help restore our attention span. We also get into the comeback of physical media, why buying CDs and ripping DVDs has become unexpectedly satisfying, and how infinite streaming choice might be making us less happy. Later in the episode, we talk Halo 3 playlist design, why modern FPS games miss the mark on fun, and a productivity warning signal to watch out for.

    "summary": "Tucked into a steep hillside in Los Angeles, the Kallis Residence is a striking example of Schindler\u2019s mastery of site-sensitive design. Created in 1946 for artist and film art director Mischa Kallis, the home embraces the contours of the slope with a dynamic composition of overlapping volumes and carefully placed terraces. After purchasing the home in 2017, homeowners John Gillespie and Susan Orlean embarked on a meticulous, multi-year restoration. Having previously lived in another Schindler-designed residence nearby, they understood the potential hidden beneath years of wear and neglect\u2014and were committed to bringing the home back to its original brilliance. \n\nOriginally conceived as two distinct structures\u2014a modest one-bedroom residence and a separate two-bedroom studio\u2014the design cleverly linked these spaces via an outdoor terrace that was later enclosed, creating a more cohesive interior environment.Schindler\u2019s signature architectural language\u2014bold geometric forms, extensive glazing, and built-in furnishings\u2014gives the house its sculptural and expressive quality. One of its most distinctive features is a vertical wood-slat screen that runs along the downslope fa\u00e7ade, simultaneously acting as a privacy element and a subtle way to integrate the home into the natural landscape. \n\nIn the 1960s, the home was acquired by members of Kallis\u2019s extended family, William and Jacqueline Sharlin. Working with architect Josef Van der Kar, a colleague of Schindler\u2019s, they updated and unified the residence, blending the original two wings into a more fluid living space. Recognized as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument, the Kallis-Sharlin Residence is a powerful reminder of Schindler\u2019s legacy. It reflects his deep commitment to designing for both the landscape and the individual\u2014a philosophy that helped shape the Southern California modernist movement.\n\nFilm - Mick Aure @miccck \nProducer - Elias Tebache @socalarchitecture \nMusic - Deep Al Brindle @DeepAlBrindle\nPhotography - @OpenSpaceSeries\n\nSpecial Thanks to John Gillespie & Susan Orlean \n@susanorlean @john.gillespie.142 \n\n\nDo you have a home that you believe could fit in our series?

And my guess is that even if you don't know the Belgian duo Soulwax (AKA 2Manydjs) by name, you'll know their biggest hits, like early 2000s indie electronic anthems \"E Talking\" or \"NY Excuse.\"\n\nIn this interview with Resident Advisor editor Gabriel Szatan, the brothers David and Stephen Dewaele talk about their decades-long career and writing their first album in more than seven years, All Systems Are Lying, which they road tested for ages before deciding to put it out. They also unpack bigger thematic arcs in their work and lives: the abiding influence of New Order's Power, Corruption and Lies LP; their creative philosophy (\"If it sounds too simple, leave it alone);\" and the nature of musical trends and revivals, which have fluctuated intensely since they began performing and releasing records.

For six months.We refused. Turkey is malware central, we deal with Viruses, Trojans, and Cracks on external harddrives every single week. Pausing patches = asking for ransomware.The CTO didn\u2019t care. He just told me:Do it anyway.I tried to explain how Intune and Office update channels work. He didn\u2019t even listen.That was the moment I decided to leave.Security Theater 101The same CTO who said \"pause Office updates\" also:Banned PsExec for \"security reasons\"Worshipped Secure ScoreHad no clue what Defender for Endpoint actually needs (or how it even works)Refused to license us for anything beyond Microsoft 365 Business Premium and basic Defender for Endpoint licenceBut still wanted full Intune lockdown, security baselines, and brandingWe ran Windows 10 Pro on all clients.No E3. No E5.No advanced threat hunting.No KQL.But he still expected results like we were running an XDR stack on autopilot.Turkey: No Staff, Just Collateral DamageThe Turkey site had no IT staff.Instead, two programmers - actually hired for programming arround ERP - were forced to manage:FirewallsServersMalware cleanupSoftware updatesLocal user supportInfrastructure issues they weren\u2019t even trained forTheir \"IT manager\"?

They had years to listen. They didn\u2019t.To everyone who read this far, replied, or just silently nodded along:thank you!Your encouragement, your stories, and your brutal empathy made me realize something i had forgotten:I'm not alone.I'm not crazy.And I\u2019m not the only one who gives a damn.This post won\u2019t change my old company.But maybe it helps someone else realize when it\u2019s time to stop patching a burning ship - and start building something better somewhere else.Company slogan?Team happy futureYeah.

Invasion Season 3 premieres August 22 on Apple TV+\nhttps://apple.co/_Invasion\n\nInvasion follows an alien invasion through different perspectives around the world. In season three, those perspectives collide for the first time, as the series\u2019 main characters are brought together to work as a team on a critical mission to infiltrate the alien mothership. The ultimate apex aliens have finally emerged, rapidly spreading their deadly tendrils across the planet.

    "summary": "I work for a gov office, we have a pretty complex network with a lot of new mixed with old solutions (we're working on it!), but not too messy as we keep things pretty tidy.About 2 months ago things just started.....crashing. When I say things I mean such various things we simply had no idea what was going on. Randomly, parts of completely unrelated systems started crashing. For example a geographic piece of software we run maps on and a storage replica that have nothing to do with each other. This spanned literally anything that has an relation to Windows.Around the same time we started noticing Workstation service is crashing on some of the affected clients and services, but this was pretty rare so we never gave it too much thought even though I literally never saw this service crash in my 10 years here.Now lets go back about a year ago, back then I noticed some servers and clients are failing to update their group policy. A quick google landed me in C:\\Windows\\System32\\GroupPolicy. Delete the contents and the issue goes away. I proceeded to create a SCCM baseline which finds the failed GPUpdate event, and if that happens it just deletes the content of said folder and runs gpupdate /force. This fixed around 95% of the problems. Rarely this didn't manage to fix the issue, at which point we usually fixed manually. My boss decided this is no good and 2 months ago asked our junior SCCM guy to come up with a better solution.You can see where this is going. Junior went to some AI which spat out 2 pieces of PowerShell code, junior applied code in the scripts of said SCCM baseline and went home happy. The code.... It changed the event that decides when to run the remediation script to any event concerning an issue with gpupdate, including warnings, and in the remediation script, on top of a mountain of unneeded BS it contained the following 2 lines:Restart-Service Netlogon -ForceRestart-Service Workstation -ForceThere are a lot of other services that depend on these 2 services and they also depend on each other, and of course things just started falling apart. I can't tell you how many hours of debugging went into this. Global support teams we alerted, product groups running insane debugging tools, we canceled storage replicas, clusters, reinstalled whole RDS farms etc etc etc.6 weeks later I caught a service failing as I was there with procmon running, and saw the script it was running and the folder the script came from. I managed to work my way from there to the baseline.The junior was not fired, even though if he only asked any one of us we would never allow such a script to run.Oh and did I mention, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T BLINDLY TRUST AI ANSWERS.submitted by/u/StrikerXTZ[link][comments]",

It has so many limitations, bugs and simply just broken in some cases. I have a M4 MacBook Air as well and it's a decent experience but I'm not an Apple person so part of the Apple experience is irrelevant to me.I had a few primary blockers for me in terms of switching to Linux. Linux being Linux wasn't one because I've been using WSL2 Ubuntu distro for quite a while and I've played around with a few Debian based distros on and off (although 80% of my experience is with Ubuntu). I am ok with the terminal and occasional time consuming troubleshoots.My main blockers were:Can I bring all my Dev tools exactly as is to Linux?Can I get Claude Desktop working with MCP support on Linux (because there's no official package)?Can I use Adobe Illustrator on Linux?Can I play World of Warcraft on Linux?Can I use Office 365 on Linux?Can I have a decent multimedia experience without any annoying driver issues, codec issues or just simply broken media experience?Enter Bazzite! A comprehensive solution for my issues.My desktop specs:Ryzen 3700x32GB RAMRTX 3060 12GB GPUMSI MAG B550 Mortar mainboard with WiFi and BluetoothI went with theBazzite Nvidia KDE Desktopedition and then revised it to theBazzite DX Nvidia KDEedition. (Never rebase cross desktop environments i.e.: KDE and GNOME, is what experts say so sure, I'd say the same thing. Anyway, why would you want to ruin your clean distro installation in the first place?)1. Dev Tools and the Dev environmentWith Bazzite DX, VS Code, Podman and Docker comes with the base and I get homebrew built in as well with Distrobox also in the base to cover for containerisation. (Containerisation is quite important as I've learned and more about it a bit later). I've made Podman the primary engine as it doesn't have root access requirements and is generally more secure and slightly better performance too.I use Cursor most of the time and there's an Appimage route to get Cursor working on Bazzite with almost no hassle at all using Gear Lever.Terminal. Now this is a very important part of the overall Dev experience. You want to feel comfortable with your terminal and you want to feel excited to use it. I usually go with zsh as my shell and ohmyzsh for the prompt with powerlevel10k theme and catppuccin mocha colours. Since I'm changing my setup, I decided to venture out and see what other options are out there.My new terminal, is the default KDE terminal. nothing fancy there. it seems like a decent enough terminal and I'm fine with it. The shell however, I switched to Fish! Its different. There indeed is a learning curve because the bash/zsh commands that I know may not work on fish. Curl installation commands is a challenge I encountered almost immediately and I still need to learn how to use it properly. But the good news is, worst case scenario, i can always bash it (which is what i did with the curl commands but I'm sure many people here would 'educate' me on how stupid I'm being without learning how to use fish properly, and yes, I will, eventually, gradually, but the workaround, WORKS and I just want to let another newbie know that).So... FISH. Well, what can I say, I like it! Especially the functions. After setting up a few functions and using it for about an hour or so, let me tell you,I'm never going back to any other shell ever again!(jk. I have to go back to bash once in a while because I'm fish noob and don't know how to properly write the fish compatible commands yet.) But seriously, I'm all in with fish and I have only scraped the surface yet I'm already impressed by how usable and feature rich it is. Highly recommended switching to fish. (first function or abbreviation you should setup is the cd functions to your most visited folders.)Next up, is the prompt. Nothing fancy there, just Homebrew Starship and did my own custom version of the Catppuccin Powerline preset (https://starship.rs/presets/catppuccin-powerline). You can try it out from here -https://github.com/hashangit/hashangit-starship-config. It's pretty, and fairly easy to customise with so many plug-in options also available to choose from. One thing I noticed is that you can't use the [git_branch], [git_status] plug-in to conditionally switch colour based on if the branch is in sync or out of sync. I would have loved to have it change to green if in sync with origin and yellow if not but, I couldn't find a way to do it. So I'm configured it to show changes vs show nothing using the [git_status] plug-in instead for now. (any feedback is welcome!)Alright, Let's get to the fun part!ContainerisationBazzite is an immutable Linux distro (more like built on top of an immutable Fedora but same difference). This is a good thing AND at the same time, it means you need a bit of extra attention when setting everything up. OS base being immutable is great and you should try your very best to keep it that way, for security as well as to prevent YOU, YOURSELF, out of ignorance, destroying your own os installation. Latter is the more important thing for someone like myself, who doesn't really know the ins and outs but learn by fiddling around. But you can gain system level access if you want, with rpm-ostree, but, so far, i haven't had the need to. Homebrew is available and it, as far as I understand, has separation already so it shouldn't affect the base os, meaning I, and also You can't destroy your system out of ignorance.So then how do you get things done in scenarios where you need system level access? Easy.SWITCH TO UBUNTU!No what I actually meant is, get an Ubuntu based container running on Distrobox and get your development enviornment setup there with your tools and dependencies. At this point, I'm sure the experts are just screaming out of their heads, telling me how wrong my approach is, and yes, I have the IDEs etc setup on my host and I have my runtimes and dependencies and and other tools setup in the container, and I'm exporting them out to the host. Is it the best way? perhaps not. Does it work just fine for my workflows? So far YES! without a hitch. So for now, this is perfectly fine as far as I'm concerned. You could have all your different projects isolated into their own individual containers including al the tools like IDEs etc but, I thought that is too much for my specific requirement. Ionly really work with JS, TS, python for NextJS, ExpressJS, NodeJS, React/ React Native, different python projects (all isolated with venv and potery) and that's about it for now so really, my requirements aren't too complex to warrant a more complex isolation approach per project. In fact, being able to use the same pnpm store across project, helps a lot in my case as I have a metered internet connection. I can write up a guide based on how I did my setup IF enough people need me to but, to be honest, getting Claude to write a custom guide for your specific scenario would be the better approach (which is what I did. I had no clue whatsoever on what I'm suppose to do in the first place when I thought of switching to Bazzite)That brings me to the next important thing in my list.Claude Desktop2. Getting Claude Desktop with MCP support to work on BazziteTruth be told, I am no expert in this. I mean I am an expert in USING Claude but not in terms of turning an electron windows app into a Linux app. So all the credit should go to the original developer on making it a really simple painless process to get Claude Desktop working with MCP supportON UBUNTU!. Alright, I'm sure you can see where I'm going with this. Just install it into the ubuntu container and export the app out to the host just like we did with pnpm, node, etc.. it just works and the instructions are so very clear and simple.Thank YouEsmiand Thank YouAaddrickHere's the link to the repo that I used:https://github.com/emsi/claude-desktop/tree/mainHere's the link to the original repo which the above one is based on:https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian3. Adobe Illustrator on LinuxApparently, this is not possible and Adobe doesn't seem to have any real intention to bring Adobe suite to Linux, at all, ever. So that's that! Honestly, I use Illustrator quite rarely as of late in my workflows (Thank You Canva) so this is nota major blocker for me anymore. I have 3 options available. I can use Illustrator on my MacBook or, I can temporarily switch to my old Windows installation for just that or I can run Windows on a VM on Bazzite and run Illustrator on that. Honestly, using Ilustrator on my MacBook is the easiest, most painless route so yeah, I don't think I'm going to bother with 'Adobe on Linux' battle.4. World of Warcraft Retail on LinuxNow, here's the funny thing. WoW Windows game works better on Linux compared to Windows! \ud83e\udef3\ud83c\udffd\ud83c\udfa4 Setting up is quite simple. The route that worked for me out of the box with no issues, is Lutris route. Bazzite comes with Lutris pre-installed. Just search forBattle.netin Lutris and install. But first, you gotta do a couple of small things.Get ProtonPlus via BazaarOn ProtonPlus, switch to Lutris from Steam on the top left corner. Scroll down to Wine, and download 'Wine-Staging-Tkg (Kron4ek)'. Anything after v10.6 works apparently and I'm using v10.12 which works in August 2025 (before retail 11.2 patch. PTR 11.2 works so no reason why 11.2 shouldn't work).Next, on Lutris, Preferences > Runners > Wine > runner Options > Wine Version and seect the newly downloaded version. Alternatively, if you have already downloadedBattle.net, you can right click, Configure > Runner Options > Wine Version and select the latest version you just downloaded. You can double-check to see if DXVK and VKD3D are enabled because you need to have those enabled.Now you can go ahead and run Battle.net. Just make sure to read what the wizaed says and do as mentioned. You want it to download the Battle.net Update Agent then run it and go all the way until the login window is presented.DON NOT LOGIN RIGHT NOW!Let's Lutris finish the installation properly.Once Lutris completes the full installation, then you can launchBattle.netand login.Now, if you are coming from Windows, and already have your game files on Windows, and don't want to download the game files again, well, you are in luck! but, you need to first do a couple of things. You need to log into your windows installation (probably for the last time in your life) and turn off 'Fast Start Up' which you may need to do through Powershell now because the control Panel and Settings aren't showing the option anymore (at least in my case) and turn off any other settings that cause the ntfs-3g driver on Linux to prevent you from mouting the Windows installation with full read / write permissions (a simple Google search can give you all the information you need on this.). This is required if your WoW game files are saved on the same drive as your Windows installation.Now, Bazite should be able to easily mount the NTFS drive with your WoW game files and you can just do this via Dolphin (file browser) itsel. (Remember to double-check if its mounted with out and write restrictions). Now its just a matter of updating the game files folder onBattle.netclient just like you normally would on Windows and point to the game files folder on the NTFS partition. This works just fine without any issues whatsoever. But the recommended way is to copy the game files folder onto your btrfs drive for best perfomance. But, personally, I'd keep it as is, just in case, if WoW has issues on Bazzite (unlikely) for some reason (even Blizzard has confirmed that while they don't officially support Linux, they would not intentionally break it either.)Launch the game and start your adventures in Azeroth and K'aresh from where you left off! (Or in Outland. Your choice. I'm not judging.)5. Office 365 on Linux.Outright, this doesn't work. But its the same story like the Adobe Illustrator. Google workspace EXISTS! And the Office 365 broswer version is adequate in most cases. If strictly need Office 365, I can use it on my MacBook, or switch to Windows for a it temporarily. Also, from my experience, Libre Office applications are more than capable and is a decent user experience unless you strictly want the Microsoft vesion for some strange reason. So this is not and issue, at least for me.6. The multimedia experienceSimple answer is, Bazzite multimedia experience (atealst in my case) isFantastic!I tried out Ubuntu 25.04 when it came out, on my Desktop, and the audio quality was bad and it sounded tinny and no bass. On Windows, since I'm using a bluetooth speaker, there's a delay between the video and audio which completely destroys the media experience. On Bazzite though, I have no such issues. Audio is deep and rich with proper bass and while i have not yet gotten to it, there are easy to use system-wide EQ tools to tune it up to your exact preference. My Speakers have SBC codec and Bazzit is correctly picking and using the SBC codec for best possible output. I have a dual 2k + 1080p monitor setup. While they are not high refresh rate monitors, I'm not seeing anything wrong with the visual experience compared to what I see on Windows and when i connect my MacBook to the same monitors. Onething I've noticed is that the default setting is to let the monitor manage the colour accuracy so if you have 2 different monitors (especially 2 different brands and 2 different panel tech like mine with HP and Samsung) you'll see the same thing in different colours. This for me is acceptable and i think depending on your monitor's capabilities, you might be able to make them lookalike with a bit a tweaking in the display configuration.So, should you switch to Bazzite?YES. It's better than Windowssubmitted by/u/Designer_Athlete7286[link][comments]",

Verizon Business has no editorial influence on our videos, but their support makes videos like these possible.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nEvery few years, someone declares the end of moviegoing. First it was cable, then VHS, then DVDs, streaming, and even COVID. And yet \u2014 the big screen persists.\n\nSure, the landscape has changed. Since 2019, the U.S. has lost nearly 5,000 movie theater screens. Big chains have struggled financially. Alamo Drafthouse, once independent, was recently acquired by Sony Pictures. And Netflix\u2019s Ted Sarandos famously claimed that moviegoing is an \u201coutdated concept.\u201d\n\nBut people still love going to the movies \u2014 and independent movie theater owners are meeting that passion head-on.\n\nAcross the country, independent cinemas are reimagining what it means to be a theater. From inventive programming and community events to affordable tickets and local partnerships, they\u2019re creating experiences that go far beyond just watching a film.\n\nWe sat down with Emelyn Stuart (Stuart Cinema), Matthew Viragh (Nitehawk Cinemas), and Thaddeus Bouchard (Screendollars) to explore how these theaters are thriving \u2014 and why the industry isn\u2019t on life support just yet.\n\nWatch Vox\u2019s latest to learn more.\n\nLinks:\n- http://nitehawkcinema.com/\n- https://www.stuartcinema.com/\n- https://screendollars.com/\n- https://cinemaunited.org/behind-the-screens/\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

We run a production mail system through Azure Communication Services (ACS) Email, which, as documented (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/email/email-overview), is completely separate from Exchange Online. It\u2019s an authenticated mail service using App Registrations, no connectors, no direct send, no relation to EXO transport pipeline at all.So what happens when we (responsibly) enable RejectDirectSend in Exchange Online to harden domain spoofing protections?Mail flow from ACS Email dies.Not a hiccup. Not a delay. A full-on \"message rejected\" scenario as if we were doing unauthenticated direct send, which we're not.Open a case with Microsoft support, and I get a politely worded, totally useless response that boils down to:\"Yeah that\u2019s expected. Direct Send from accepted domains gets blocked when you flip the switch. Configure a connector or disable it.\"WHAT CONNECTOR? What are you even talking about?!ACS Email is not an Exchange Online workload. It authenticates through Azure, not Exchange. It doesn\u2019t use direct send, and there\u2019s no way to configure a connector for it in Exchange Online, nor should there be. This is literally Microsoft breaking their own mail platform with another Microsoft product\u2019s security feature.How do you even QA this kind of thing?So now we\u2019re in a position where a global mail solution billed as enterprise-grade and scalable for apps/services is dependent on Exchange Online not having one specific setting enabled, a setting that\u2019s there to prevent spoofing.Let me say that again: a security feature in EXO breaks Microsoft\u2019s own separate, authenticated, app-to-email service.The cherry on top: Support telling us to \u201cconfigure a partner connector\u201d and \u201ccheck SPF.\u201d As if this were a traditional SMTP relay scenario.No. This is a secure, authenticated service designed for cloud-first applications. You broke it by accident, and the response is basically, \"Oops, sorry.\"This is the kind of crap that makes IT pros want to jump ship and go live in the woods.Microsoft: Either separate your services properly or document the fact that internal product lines can silently brick each other.And no, I will not be \u201ctemporarily disabling\u201d domain spoofing protections because you couldn\u2019t design your systems to talk to each other.Unacceptablesubmitted by/u/Intrepid_Chard_3535[link][comments]",

    "summary": "In case you haven't already heard, EA has decided to actively block Proton, Wine or SteamDeck from running their brand new shooter, as they have already done for other titles of the saga, such as BF1.After the Windows 11 debacle and many users quitting Windows seemingly forever after being forced to buy new hardware to feed Bill Gates' already full pockets. it would be a step back for everyone in the Linux community and otherwise to simply roll over and take it up the ass when it comes to this new occurrence.I've already heard people in other subreddits pushing users to dual-boot what is essentially spy- and ad-ware on their machines, because there will be no other way to play this game, not only because EA and DICE are incompetent enough to produce anticheat that support Proton (much like EasyAntiCheat has been able to do forever) but also because they outright don't give a fuck about us users.I don't only refer to Linux users in the previous sentence, but to every single user of a PC anywhere in the world. What do EA care if you choose to play their brand spanking new game that costs 70 bucks on any hardware of your choosing? Why require SecureBoot to run the game? Are they that incompetent? Yes, but not only that, as I've already said! They simply don't give a fuck about consumers, and just want to make a quick buck out of you!We must all rise to the occasion by boycotting this game to show this company that their extortion techniques will be met with nothing less than outright war.Thank you very much for coming to my TED talk.EDIT:I'm told Bill Gates only owns 1% of Microsoft now. I extend my deeply felt hatred to all corpos running that particular company and all others that seek to destroy consumers in their endless greed. This includes, of course, Nvidia for refusing to collaborate in making open-source drivers for their cards unlike what AMD has been able to do.EDIT 2:Since I keep on seeing some points repeated over and over in the comment section, I would like to clarify my position on these.I didn't expect this post to have that much impact in the general PC community anyway. It was meant more as a reflection into how giving up on Windows after the Windows 11 debacle and then going back to dual-booting might not be an option for some users given they might not be unable to install Windows 11 at all, which is a kick in the face for consumers.There are (at least) two big camps of people in the comment section. One part says \"LOL just dual boot\". Again, this might not be an option for some people, and even if it is, it's a kick in the face to have to do so.Another camp says \"is it really a boycott if Linux doesn't support it so we can't install it?\" I know, that's the point behind the post, the idea of reinstalling Windows (if you are able to do so) just to play this game is stupid in my eyes, hence I made this rant post. Some people might feel inclined to do so, and I wanted to give them a counterargument against that decision.Once again, I don't expect 4% of the PC playerbase \"boycotting\" (or simply not being able to install) this game to have any impact, of course not, but it doesn't personally feel right to pay 70 bucks for a game I can't run on my machine unless I use what has turned out to be adware and spyware. It doesn't feel right to support outright incompetence/malice by giving them my money so they can run code within my computer's kernel because they can't / don't care enough to come up with a better solution. I know I'm preaching to the converted, just wanted to voice my opinion and reasoning once again.EDIT 3:To anyone thinking I'm somehow forcing people to boycott this game or do anything at all, I have no power over anyone, especially over the Internet, since I'm no Jedi. You sure better contact the Council if you think you have the ability to do so, but that ain't me. I also have no intention of turning \"this\" (this subreddit? this Linux community? I really don't know...) into a religion or a cult by imposing my views, as some commenters have stated.To everyone: kindly do whatever you want, I'm not holding you at gunpoint, I just wanted to voice my take.submitted by/u/ChemiCalChems[link][comments]",

Opting for the character of an older building over a modern condo, Lisa has crafted a space that functions as a personal art gallery, championing the work of Black, POC, and local Toronto artists. This home is a stunning example of intentional maximalism, where every object and art piece is chosen with purpose and tells a part of her story.\n\nThe tour begins in a welcoming entryway featuring vibrant art celebrating Black girlhood, setting the tone for a home filled with identity and pride. From a tiny bathroom with unique vintage flooring to a cozy bedroom built around a cherished antique nightstand, personal history is woven into the fabric of the decor. The living room is the apartment's centerpiece, featuring a stunning gallery wall with works by artists like Mark Stoddart and Attos Setu, each piece holding deep significance. Across the room, colorful paintings by Kalkidan Assefa and Quinton Versetti bring the vibrancy of Toronto inside.\n\nBeyond the art, this tour is packed with inspiration for small space living. See how Lisa created a dedicated dining nook, uses a bookcase to display her love for literature (spines out!), and seamlessly integrates her cat's needs with stylish, functional furniture. From her views on displaying family photos to her love for the nostalgia of fridge magnets and memories of Honest Ed's, Lisa's tour is more than just interior design. It's a lesson in how to build a home that is a sanctuary of personal expression, community, and heritage.\n\n#apartmenttour #torontoapartment #hometour #artfilledhome #maximalism #intentionalmaximalism #blackart #pocart #interiordesign #toronto #smallapartment #olderapartment #vintageapartment #nevertoosmall #apartmenttherapy #theartofinteriors",

He\u2019s a media theorist, author of Survival of the Richest and Team Human, and host of the Team Human podcast.

    "summary": "This homestead includes two handcrafted natural homes, a geodesic dome greenhouse built from local stone, a hand-dug stream, two natural swimming ponds, a bamboo maze, and a thriving permaculture garden and orchard with over 2,000 plants. It\u2019s a place where the home doesn\u2019t just shelter you\u2014it feeds you, cools and heats itself, filters your air, and invites you to slow down and live well.\n\nIt\u2019s the work of Vicente Nadal, a pioneer in natural building in his part of Spain, Pa\u00eds Valenci\u00e0. Tucked away in a quiet canyon near Alicante\u2014just beyond the bustle of the Mediterranean coast\u2014 he\u2019s blending ancient building knowledge with smart, low-tech innovation. Vicente believes the future lies in remembering what we've forgotten: using local materials, designing with the climate, and creating homes that actually give back.\n\nHere, nearly everything is made from stone, lime, and wood found on the land. The main house\u2014once a plain stucco structure\u2014is now full of organic curves and warmth, with thick walls that insulate and sculpted heated benches built into the design. The smaller home features a clever modular wall system that converts the open-plan studio into a two-bedroom layout in seconds. The dome greenhouse is not only functional, but striking\u2014built by hand with lime mortar and wood for growing food year-round.\n\nVicente designs homes that blend with nature and are health-enhancing. He uses lime plasters and paints inside and out, which naturally absorb CO\u2082, filter indoor air, and resist mold and bacteria. For cooling, a DIY \u201cCanadian Well\u201d system (AKA earth-coupled air cooling system) brings in fresh air from underground. For heating, thermal inertia stoves made with natural materials release warmth slowly over 24 hours using minimal wood\u2014heating both the space and the built-in seating with efficiency and beauty.\n\nThe land is shaped to support water and life: a meandering stream crosses under a stone Roman-style bridge, feeding two deep, natural ponds that help filter water and provide a habitat for frogs, dragonflies, and fish. There\u2019s even an outdoor limestone shower that, four years on, still looks like new\u2014thanks to limestone\u2019s natural resistance to stains and microbes.\n\nEven the finishing touches are rooted in local wisdom. Esparto blinds hang on the outside of windows, blocking harsh summer sun while letting in dappled light\u2014and on hot days, they can be misted to cool the air that enters the home. A treehouse built from leftover wood and salvaged windows, a mountain bike trail, and winding paths through the orchard show how joy, play, and function all coexist here. \n\nFor Vicente, this kind of building isn\u2019t a niche lifestyle\u2014it\u2019s a return to sanity. When you treat your home as an ecosystem, it becomes something that supports your health, grows your food, powers your comfort, and connects you to the land.\n\nhttps://www.rustega.es/\nUpdates about Vicente's builds  https://www.instagram.com/rustegabioconstruccion/\n\nOn *faircompanies: https://faircompanies.com/videos/building-private-eco-village-with-diy-stone-dome-and-full-ecosystem-%f0%9f%8c%bf%f0%9f%90%9f/",

The trailer they used is from Iron Eagle, and they chose it because the floor of the trailer is sunken down which provides some much needed vertical inches to make sure they had enough head room on the main floor and up in the loft.\n\nAlex and Al tried to use as many reclaimed and local materials as possible to reduce waste on the project, including using salvaged cedar shingles and planks for their siding, flooring from an old bowling alley, and locally milled wood.  For their interior walls, they used Wedi board and plastered it with venetian plaster for a stunning finish.\n\nStorage and space to cook were two major priorities with their design, so they have 38 large drawers to make sure they can keep the tiny space organized, and they have loads of counter space in the galley kitchen for preparing large meals and canning preserves.\n\nAlex and Al heat their tiny home with wood, and they made sure to get their wood stove WETT certified.  Another thing they did to help make sure they could get home insurance was to skirt their tiny home and remove the wheels.  By doing this, they were able to get mobile home insurance which was cheaper than tiny house insurance.\n\nTheir covered porch almost doubles their living space and was built using glass from secondhand sliding doors, and driftwood posts from a nearby beach.  The deck itself is built in sections so that it can be taken apart and moved if they have to find a new location.\n\nFinding parking for the tiny house was challenging and the couple is currently at their third location.  The first was an old covered mill where they began their build, but were evicted along with the other folks on the land.  The second was a nice forested site but it did not have any services so it was only used to complete their build.  Their third parking spot was found by putting up posters in the neighbourhoods where they wanted to live.  It has water, electricity, and septic, and they only had to bring in their own internet.  \n\nThe land rent is more affordable than renting an apartment or home in their area, and they also contribute to the landlords in other ways like chopping their firewood.  \n\nYou can follow and find out more about Alex's weaving at Alex Rooted here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/alexrooted\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@alexrooted\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@alexrooted\nhttps://www.alexrooted.com/\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nSTAY IN TOUCH!\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWebsite: www.exploringalternatives.ca\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/exploringalternativesblog\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/exploringalternatives/\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nCOMMENTS\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe want our channel and comments section to be an inclusive space where everyone feels welcome to watch and contribute.
