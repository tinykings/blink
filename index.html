<div id="summary-0-11" class="summary" style="display: none;">Power outage last night caused a bunch of issues, even with battery backups and a back-up generator. This morning one of the techs tells me that the XP computer that runs specialized software for a large manufacturing machine in production won't power on and gave a blue screen "KERNAL_STACK_INPAGE_ERROR" and after a reboot, nothing. Black screen.So now I'm reaching out to the database admin who is still in touch with the person who had my role before me who supposedly used to make clones of this hard drive in an effort to figure out where he might have kept these backup drives. Meanwhile production is stalled. Happy Friday! Happy Sysadmin Day!There were no notes about this when I started six months ago and I'm just learning about it now. And I'm supposed to leave early for a friend's wedding this weekend. Sheesh.submitted by/u/hevvypiano[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-0-23" class="summary" style="display: none;">Survive the horror. Unravel the truth. Watch the latest Code Violet trailer for this upcoming third-person action horror game. The new Code Violet trailer showcases more of the story, even more fights against deadly dinosaurs, and announces a release date. Code Violet will be available on PlayStation 5 (PS5) on November 14, 2025.

In the 25th century, a cataclysm has left Earth uninhabitable, driving humanity’s survivors to Trappist 1-E. Facing extinction due to sterility, the Aion colony harnesses cutting-edge time-travel technology to abduct women from the past to be surrogates in a dark yet desperate bid to save mankind.

But their mission conceals a sinister conspiracy. As Violet Sinclair, torn from your time, you awaken in the Aion Bioengineering Complex, swarming with ferocious prehistoric dinosaurs and hostile forces. Carefully manage your inventory, uncover Aion’s dark secrets, fight to survive, and escape during a chaotic evacuation protocol.

Can you save those you care for and make it out alive?</div>

Odenkirk joined IGN at SDCC to talk about how much he loves Jackie Chan movies, the unglamorous situation he found himself in with Sharon Stone and how he would murder Alvin and the Chipmunks by stepping on them real hard. Plus we find out how his Nobody character Hutch Mansell would fare in combat against other characters who famously went on vacation in their sequels and who he respects for just throwing bricks at people's heads.

The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is Samsung's latest foldable smartphone and it is easily the best one yet. It's insanely thin, light, and powerful, while borrowing the 200mp camera from the S25 Ultra, and somehow still packing the same size battery inside.

I spent the past 15 days using the Z Fold 7 alongside my iPhone 16 Pro and was shocked with the results and just how much I used this phone. Here are my thoughts on the Galaxy Z Fold 7 in terms of practicality, battery life, performance, cameras, AI features, and more. Enjoy!

This week we explore a brilliant industrial modern style tiny house thats located just a stone's throw from downtown Sydney. This really is a tiny house with it all - a lovely private parking spot yet still in the absolute heart of everything! 

Zoe and Reece have built their dream tiny house here. It may be tiny but it’s absolutely packed full of style. From the moment Zoe first laid eyes on a tiny home, she knew that she wanted to build one. Reece admits he took a bit of convincing but the couple dived in to this project together and the result is amazing. They have created a stylish home with a strong industrial modern vibe. 

This home has a truly unique vibe, from it’s moody, cosy dark interior and use of strong materials like metal, concrete and a collection of reclaimed materials such as a stained glass door and a feature lamp from an old firehouse, this eclectically styled home is packed full of personality! 

One of the best things about this tiny house is that it's fully legal! Getting the tiny home approved by the city was not an easy task, but they managed to do it! 

Living in the tiny house has helped to give this young couple not only their very first home, but it’s enabled them to take some big risks. Lower overheads have allowed Zoe to focus on her sport where she represents Australia in weightlifting! Currently she is training for the Commonwealth Games with her eyes on the Olympics in the future. You can follow her sporting journey via Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/zoe.lisha/

We hope you enjoy the tour of this very special urban tiny home! ❤️

<div id="summary-0-64" class="summary" style="display: none;">In this Linux gaming benchmark video, I compare two modern and gaming-focused Linux distributions: **Bazzite Linux** and **PikaOS**.

🔹 **Bazzite** is based on Fedora and optimized for gaming PCs and Steam Deck, featuring Proton GE, GameMode, and Flatpak integration for a seamless gaming experience.

🔹 **PikaOS**, based on Debian, is built specifically for gamers and content creators. It comes pre-installed with Proton GE, Wine, and DXVK, and includes performance tweaks out-of-the-box.

<div id="summary-0-70" class="summary" style="display: none;">Cyberpunk 2077 remains prolific five years on from its original release, with Switch 2 and now Apple Mac versions arriving. A visual benchmark in many ways and a literal benchmark in terms of hardware testing, we were extremely eager to put CD Projekt RED's latest port to the test. Oliver checks out the game running across the stack of the latest Apple Silicon, from M4-powered Mac Mini through to the mighty M3 Ultra in Mac Studio. And of course, we have the PC performance comparisons you may have been looking for...

Many thanks to Apple for supplying the test hardware.

<div id="summary-0-72" class="summary" style="display: none;">The Buccaneers Season 2 is now streaming on Apple TV+ https://www.apple.co/_Buccaneers

In the first season of The Buccaneers, a group of fun-loving young American girls exploded into the tightly corseted London of the 1870s … setting hearts racing and kicking off an Anglo-American culture clash. Now the Buccaneers are no longer the invaders — England is their home. In fact, they’re practically running the place. Nan is the Duchess of Tintagel, the most influential woman in the country. Conchita is Lady Brightlingsea, heroine to a wave of young American heiresses. And Jinny is on every front page, wanted for the kidnapping of her unborn child. All of the girls have been forced to grow up and now have to fight to be heard, as they wrestle with romance, lust, jealousy, births and deaths … themes consuming all women of any age, no matter what year it is. Last time we got a taste of England. This time we’re in for a veritable feast.

Written by series creator Katherine Jakeways, season two is directed by BAFTA Award winner William McGregor, DGA Award winner Rachel Leiterman, John Hardwick and Charlie Manton. Jakeways, BAFTA Award nominee Beth Willis and BAFTA Award winner Susanna White serve as executive producers. “The Buccaneers” is produced for Apple TV+ by The Forge Entertainment, a Banijay UK company.

Qwen-3 coder blew most everybody away this week, topping Claude Code and Gemini CLI as the new kind of AI coding tools. Hume put out an impressive new EVI 3 model with a "personality cloning" feature and we'll test that out. We'll also test out the trippy MirageLSD demo, and do some follow up on Grok 4 and ChatGPT Agent. All that and more in the video, enjoy!

“Foundation” has captivated audiences with its intricate world-building, stunning visuals, bold storytelling, and compelling performances. Season 3 continues the epic chronicle of a band of exiles on their monumental journey to save humanity and rebuild civilization amid the fall of the Galactic Empire. 

Set 152 years after the events of Season 2, the Foundation has become increasingly established far beyond its humble beginnings while the Cleonic Dynasty’s Empire has dwindled. As both of these galactic powers forge an uneasy alliance, a threat to the entire galaxy appears in the fearsome form of a warlord known as “The Mule” whose sights are set on ruling the universe by use of physical and military force, as well as mind control. It’s anyone’s guess who will win, who will lose, who will live, and who will die as Hari Seldon, Gaal Dornick, the Cleons, and Demerzel play a potentially deadly game of intergalactic chess.

To celebrate the release of Mafia: The Old Country (⁨@mafiagame, @2KAllDay ) we’re looking back at the graphical evolution of the series so far.

Join us as we chart two decades of visual innovation in one of gaming’s most iconic crime sagas.

01:17 - Mafia (2002) - Better than Vice City?
03:38 - Mafia 2 (2010) - Partnering with Nvidia
06:04 - Mafia 3 (2016) - Cult classic or wasted potential?
08:22 - Mafia Trilogy (2020) - Reviving the classics
10:07 - Mafia: The Old Country (2025) - Is Unreal Engine 5 a help or a hindrance?

<div id="summary-0-94" class="summary" style="display: none;">Want to instantly translate your videos with AI that actually matches your voice and lip movement?  I used HeyGen’s video translator to translate a portion of this video, and it blew me away.
If you're an engineer, builder, or consultant creating content for global teams, this tool is a must-have. You can even upload a single photo of yourself, and HeyGen will generate a full video using the script you provide.
 👉 Try HeyGen here: https://bit.ly/4kQwbzc

 The most valuable skill for AI engineers in 2025 isn’t coding, it’s communication.
In this video, I break down:
 – Why technical talent isn’t enough in a cross-functional AI world
 – Real stories from my consulting work where poor communication blocked great AI projects
 – How I use tools like HeyGen to scale explainers, tutorials, and internal updates
 – The data behind why employers are prioritizing soft skills, especially in AI-adjacent roles
If you want to lead, not just build, this is the skill to master.

<p class="published-date">2025-07-25 06:30:36</p>

<button class="toggle-summary-btn" data-target="summary-0-101">...</button>
<div id="summary-0-101" class="summary" style="display: none;">President Trump sparred with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell yesterday, during his visit to the central bank to inspect a renovation project that he’s been criticizing.

Presidents don’t normally visit the Fed, which strongly protects its independence, but Trump has been very critical of the central bank, saying it’s been too slow to cut interest rates. And then Trump tussled with Powell about the final cost of the Fed’s renovations, which are projected to hit $2.5 billion.

Waving a document, Trump claimed the costs had now reached $3.1 billion as Powell visibly shook his head in disagreement. Powell took a look at the paper and pointed out that Trump was citing a number for a separate building whose construction was completed five years ago.

After that, Trump appeared more conciliatory, avoiding delving into his recent criticism of Powell.</div>

<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PscmYeDZhlY" target="_blank">Finally Understand NAT and PAT, Wireshark shows every translation</a></h2>
<p class="published-date">2025-07-25 06:30:23</p>

<button class="toggle-summary-btn" data-target="summary-0-102">...</button>
<div id="summary-0-102" class="summary" style="display: none;">NAT and PAT power almost every home and enterprise network. In this video I show you, step by step, how private RFC1918 addresses are translated to public addresses, why IPv4 exhaustion forced us to use NAT, how Cisco’s inside-local and inside-global terms actually map to packets, and I prove it all live with Wireshark and tshark.

You’ll learn:
• NAT vs PAT in plain English
• The three RFC1918 ranges: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16
• Why IPv4 ran out and how NAT delayed disaster
• Why ISPs block private ranges on the internet
• IPv6 usually doesn’t need NAT
• Cisco’s inside local, inside global, outside local, outside global explained with a capture
• Packet-by-packet proof using Wireshark and tshark

<div id="summary-0-115" class="summary" style="display: none;">Marvel’s Fantastic Four finally delivers the movie we’ve all been waiting for. I break down what worked, why this version feels so different, and how it, for the first time, really nails what the Fantastic Four are and should be in the MCU. Let’s talk about the CGI, acrots, story, and what this could mean for Marvel’s future. I'll go over my initial thoughs spoiler free. The cast. This take on Marvel 828. What it means for the MCU and my final verdict.

      "summary": "Has anyone here ever been hired as a regular IT employee, only to end up becoming the only IT person after your supervisor leaves without a title change, raise, or extra compensation?That\u2019s what happened to me.I was hired to do standard IT support and project work, but once my manager left, I was informed I\u2019m now on call 24/7. I\u2019m expected to handle: \u2022 All helpdesk tickets \u2022 Infrastructure/system admin \u2022 Product procurement \u2022 Emergency calls even on weekends, overnights, and while I was in the hospitalAccording to our employee handbook, employees working extra hours outside their standard duties are eligible for bonus pay as long as they aren\u2019t supervisors or execs. I\u2019m not a supervisor, yet was told I don\u2019t qualify because I\u2019m salaried. Plus law says helpdesk can't be considered exempt which is a huge part of my job. I directly assist every one in the company in office or out. I was instructed to only put 8 hours a day and then this year told after my predecessor left to put actual time worked but not allowed to flex that time either or get paid extra. Anyone who tries to put in a two weeks gets fired on the spot and walked out publicly for the embarrassment factor even it it gives a person unemployement.To top it off, my predecessor made $100K more than I currently do, and I was told that I\u2019m not eligible for a raise until the annual review period at year\u2019s end. CEO/Owner who i report directly to is HR too lol No remoting allowed at all for IT so no WFH. Can't even remote in from your desk in office. People get yelled at publicly in front of others by the owner at a moments notice even if it was his fault. Any idea how uncomfortable it is to watch people in their 40s get talked to like their stupid publicly. Due to my predecessor never writing documentation there is NO writing of the environment except what I have put together to the point when external experts were hired they said they can't fix a problem if the company doesn't have the ability to tell them where anything is or the proper credentials. Every document they have has been written by me after figuring things out. Software and hardware dating back to 2003. Its a nightmare to constantly have to work on EOL devices and software.Just wondering has anyone else had their role quietly change like this without any proper recognition? How did you handle it?submitted by/u/Thatmangifted[link][comments]",

My current setup was made from cheap second hand hardware just to test if I could switch to Bazzite permanently for my daily workstation.I've been gaming and video editing away for over 4 months now and even though I knew I was severely CPU limited I still have had an excellent experience running Bazzite so far; even despite the minor Nvidia quirks. Overall the experience has been eye-opening. Even tho my Bazzite rig is technically slower than my current Windows rig, the overall experience has been smoother and more responsive.Still, I wanted to get some benchmarks in before I upgrade.I'm currently still running a:- Intel Core i5-7400 (4c4t)- 2x16GB Corsair DDR4-3200- Asus Z170i Pro Gaming- Asus RTX2080Ti Dual OC- Bazzite 42 - Linux 6.15.6-101.bazzite.fc42.x86_64 - Nvidia 575.64.03 - Proton ExperimentalI got the following results:Benchmark3DMarksGraphicsPhysics/CPUCombinedFirestrike143682896360255318Firestrike Extreme103821438160355178Firestrike Ultra6421715961453767Night Raid21270527414855n/aPort Royal71117111n/an/a\\THESE RESULTS ARE MARKED NOT VALID BY 3DMARK\\. Most likely because 3Dmark can't collect system info under Linux and/or other compatibility issues. Other 3DMark benchmarks didn't want to run (yet) and crashed after loading.Compared to my previous results under Windows 10 my results are about 10% lower.Which is a very reasonable amount considering the current state of Nvidia drivers under Linux.Please don't read too much into my results as my current Core i5 is really limiting the system as a whole, but I thought I'd provide a data point for people to compare to.

I installed it on my main PC as a desktop/gaming OS, and it has given me the best experience I have ever had on Linux. It's more out of the box than Windows or MacOS, in my opinion. It even has the Wallpaper Engine plugin preinstalled! You never need to use the terminal, and if you do, there are resources right there to click on.

      "summary": "TL;DR: When playing team games, we don't have to be judged by our worst moments. Our first death doesn't have to mean 45 minutes of our team flaming us.Playing in random matchmaking doesn't have to mean playing with strangers!You can meet new people and have reason to trust and cheer for them.We have the technology! Why aren't we using it? Well... somehow that's because of Putin.---So I'm a psychological specialist working in game design, designing systems to have the right experience and shape the desired behavior - often in hidden ways. As my NDA expired and I'm leaving the industry to go work on making humans and AI not kill each other, I'll share the details of a system that wasunapologetically manipulativein the best possible way and which I still think could fundamentally change the experience of team games.Once upon a MOBAIt all started when an awesome company making awesome co-op games(BetaDwarf - you may know them from their origin story when they went viral for moving into an unused university classroom andsomehow succeeding stealth checks for 7 months straight, as they all lived together in secret, making games)planned a game with a bold vision:Fight the loneliness epidemic, by making a team game that forges the deep, meaningful friendships we knew from old WoW, but without the game needing to consume your life.The psychological specialist designer they brought in for inventing new systems to achieve that? Me.The genre they chose as the canvas for crafting this social utopia? MOBA. Erhm... yeah... FML. (Bright side:At least it was PvE and crafted for exciting teamplay experiences.)So you can see why I had to desperately innovate. Good thing I know a thing or two about conditioning and am an industry professional at making things that are mathematically rigged to achieve the outcome I want.You will comply!What is missing from team gaming?To properly quantify how fucked I was, the first step was to identify what the design needed to accomplish. These were the literal design goals:Players should not feel the pressure of having to prove their worth every game. This pressure seems to be a primary cause of toxicity when someone has a bad game.When party members are doing bad, you should have reasons to be on their side socially + understand that they aren't idiots but normally play fine and are just having a bad game.Provide greater feeling of social safety in speaking with new people you meet.Provide social validation and conversation starters for new people you meet. Mutual friends can be even more powerful friendshipping factors than shared experiences.... Simple, right?The Grand Plan Of Social Harmony Indoctrination\u2122Ok, we've got this!Step 1: Copy Overwatch! ... Wait what? This just gets worse doesn't it?First we lay out the building blocks with a commendation system.You can give a high but limited number of commendations per day (e.g. 20). Upvoting is a choice, not a default and if someone doesn't give you a commendation, they could just have been out of upvotes.When giving a commendation, you choose specific praise. E.g. 'Nice communication', 'Great teamplay', 'Good teacher', 'Saved our asses'.On the commendation screen, players are told that giving out commendations to people they like playing withwill help them meet other good people in match making. There should be a sense that you arebuilding your reputationand that thepeople you get matched with are of a quality that you have \"earned\".See how we're planting the seeds? Randoms are stupid, but you're forging a matchmaking experience not of randoms.Step 2: Unleash the prejudice! Muahaha!Imagine you join a game, and the first thing everyone sees about you is 1-2 pieces of social proof, algorithmically individualized for each of them, based on what we think will manipulate people most. Examples:\"Also friends with Anton and Alex.\" or \"8 mutual friends\"\"Gave you 'Great Teamplay'. (Goblin Hunt, level 30, 04/08/2020)\".\"You gave 'Great Teamplay'. (Goblin Hunt, level 30, 04/08/2020)\".Has received commendations from 4 of your friends.Has received commendations from 8 people you gave commendations.Has received 'Nice Communication' from 2 people you gave 'Nice Communication'.So instead of you meeting rando \"Legolas934\", you meet \"Legolas934 (also friends with Alex. Has received commendations from 8 people you gave commendations.)\"And when he dies? He's not descended from the matchmaker's infinite well of malice to punish you in particular - he's someone who's earned the respect of you or your peers but has a bad game.The beauty? It's mathematically rigged!You're building a web of trust. You'reearningbetter matchmaking. The game is telling you that your carefully chosen commendations are forging you a better matchmaking pool.And true enough, as a new player you're just playing with strangers who have commendations from strangers. But the more you play, the more commendations you give and the more friends you make, you will rapidly see more and more powerful validation of the people you're playing with.We're already starting pretty strong with friends of friends (great conversation starter for new friendships!) and people appreciated by those you appreciate. But for a veteran account who has played for months and years? You will have given commendations to a grand number of people.Suddenly that player feeding at their worst is someone you already know you gave 4 commendations when you happened to meet them at their best.You're not stupid, right?Much easier to accept that they're just having a bad game and could use some support. (Yes, I'm weaponizing your ego against you. Deal with it.)The exponential joys of villainy (for good, I promise!)At this point the benefits just keep coming.Matchmaking:Well, forging better matchmaking doesn'thaveto just be a psychological illusion. Whenever we're picking between equally suited matches, we tie-break for the ones that have the best social validation for each other. (There, it's actually true now. You really do forge better matchmaking with your commendation choices. How much does it impact? That's for you to interpret... but clearly you're getting matches with more and more validation!)Friendshipping:So many juicy opportunities!You're playing alone. You get matched with 2 people and immediately learn that they're also friends of one of your friends.You're playing alone. You get matched with someone you had good experiences playing with in the past (reminders of that experience helpfully highlighted by the grand indoctrination system, no need to thank me) + one of that person's friends.You're playing with 1 friend. You know from experience that it's no problem because it usually only takes 1-3 games before you meet someone you'll want to keep along in the final party slot and quite likely add as a friend when the session is done.Guilds:We've all seen those soulless guilds of anonymity and despair that are so common in modern games. Now we've crafted the tools to improve that.For each guild member and new joiner, you can hardly browse them without seeing notes and highlights of experiences you've had together in the past, along with commendations. If you're more recent players and have never played, it \"just\" shows you commendations and experiences from some of the players we detect you most enjoy playing with. (There. Convenient opportunity for spontaneous play and new friendshipping initiation. Fetch!)Anonymous guild auto-joining is the bane of all joy in life. Now:When you browse guilds, they're prioritized based on social and validation overlap.When you apply, the officers see applicants' validation from guild members.When giving commendations, guild members of sufficient rank can choose to also sponsor someone for the guild. If they apply, officers see that you've recommended them.And again: How often have you looked at a friend list of 40 people who you know all started from a great experience but you never followed up and now you only remember 5 of them? Having auto-notes for guild members and friends just helps people form and keep bonds by reminding you of what you've shared.How come this system never released? Why am I learning of this glorious villainy from a shady whistleblower on Reddit?Well... It all ended when the Ice Nation attacked.BetaDwarf was crushing it with their most ambitious game ever, on every level scaling for greatness. Playtesters were putting in 20 hour marathons and having amazing co-op experiences. Investors were stoked and saying how this was one of the most promising games they'd ever seen.And that's when Putin invaded. At the crucial juncture, the financial world got thrown into chaos. The investors had to focus on desperately keeping their existing projects afloat. BetaDwarf went through some tough circumstances and had to do a major pivot on the project, which also took me elsewhere.Don't worry about BetaDwarf - they recovered and, as they've done before, they managed to turn the situation into acool game(that I ended up spending like 50 hours on in their early playtest). They're headed for good things. But while the new game is still very much built for intense teamplay and forging strong social bonds, it's morphed from MOBA to a PvPvE co-op extraction game with different needs than the system they pioneered to radically transform some of the greatest social challenges in gaming.Years have passed. I've worked many other projects. Yet as I'm now changing careers, this Malevolent Indoctrination Engine of Enthusiastic Friendshipping\u2122 remains the one design I most wish to see out in the world and getting its chance to make a difference in gaming communities at scale. I'm hoping BetaDwarf won't blame me for sharing this, but I suspect they'll understand. They've been more committed to advancing social play than any other company I've ever worked at, and I think the world should have a chance to try out this particular of their inventions. May it spread wide and far and gloriously manipulate people on a global scale (for friendship! I promise!).___(Please, someone steal this. I don't care about credit, just build on it and pay it forward. Game communities have brought so many great things into my life - yet as I'm teaching my daughter the joys of gaming, I'm still fantasizing about one day being able to turn on chat.)Update:It's been less than 2 hours and I've already had several developers reach out (including franchises with player bases in the millions), saying they're looking into using these ideas to help their players form friendships more easily and treat each other better. I think it's happening!Also, this post has even more shares than upvotes. What even is this? Really seems this is catching industry attention and people are passing this around. <3Update 2:5000+ shares!? I have never seen anything being spread around like this. In some periods the shares are climbing twice as fast as the upvotes.So much thanks to everyone who is helping bring this into our gaming communities!I don't need credit, but I'd love it if you reach out with your stories like some already have.Update 3:Shares are OVER 9000!? IGDA has reached out and urged me to submit theMalevolent Indoctrination Engine of Enthusiastic Friendshippingfor a presentation at GDC!submitted by/u/EjnarH[link][comments]",

This is the Summer Edition, so here\u2019s what\u2019s been in the mix: I finally beat Tomb Raider 2013 and Halo Reach on Legendary (that was a ride), been chipping away at Hi-Fi Rush, squeezing in some Stardew Valley in the mornings, and even picked up House Flipper on sale just for fun.

Remnick\u2019s jurisdiction is turned upside-down when a prison transport plane crashes in the remote wilderness, setting free dozens of violent inmates. Tasked with protecting the town he\u2019s vowed to keep safe, he begins to suspect the crash wasn\u2019t an accident, but the first step of a well-crafted plan with far-reaching and devastating implications.\n\nIn addition to Clarke, the ensemble cast includes Dominic Cooper (\u201cThe Gold\u201d), Haley Bennett (\u201cThe Magnificent Seven\u201d), Simone Kessell (\u201cYellowjackets\u201d), Dallas Goldtooth (\u201cReservation Dogs\u201d), and Tait Blum (\u201cFor All Mankind\u201d), with Academy Award Nominee and multi-Emmy winner Alfre Woodard (\u201cClemency\u201d).\n\nHailing from Apple Studios, The Last Frontier is executive produced by Bokenkamp and D\u2019Ovidio, who also serve as writers, alongside Clarke, Laura Benson (\u201cThe Big C\u201d), Glenn Kessler (\u201cBloodlines\u201d), Albert Kim (\u201cNikita\u201d), and series episodic director Sam Hargrave (\u201cExtraction\u201d).\n\nSubscribe to Apple TV\u2019s YouTube channel: https://apple.co/AppleTVYouTube\n\nFollow Apple TV:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleTV\nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@AppleTV\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/AppleTV\nX: https://X.com/AppleTV\nGiphy: https://giphy.com/AppleTV\n\nFollow Apple Films:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleFilms\nX: https://X.com/AppleFilms\n\nMore from Apple TV: https://apple.co/32qgOEJ\n\nApple TV+ is a streaming service with original stories from the most creative minds in TV and film.

In this quick networking tutorial I show two eye-safe methods to test any single-mode or multi-mode fiber patch lead, no expensive meter required. First, aim your smartphone camera at the connector; most phone sensors detect the otherwise invisible 850\u20131550 nm IR signal coming from our 10 Gb Cisco switch. Next, I attach a visible-red VFL (visual fault locator) so you can see the difference between infrared and test laser light. Along the way you\u2019ll learn why only one strand glows (Tx vs. Rx), why staring down fiber can permanently damage eyesight, and how to apply this trick in data-center or home-lab environments. Perfect for CCNA/CCNP students, IT support, fiber splicers, smart-home builders, and anyone working with high-speed internet links.

Studio Karhard, the architecture firm started by Thomas Karsten and his wife, Alexandra Erhard, in 2003, know exactly which ingredients go into a successful nightlife space. The Berlin-based duo are the visionaries behind Berghain and \u2204 in Kyiv, as well as a number of private residences, businesses and smaller venues around the world. Their specialty, they say, is salvaging forgotten spaces and resurrecting them to serve a new purpose.\n\nIn this RA Exchange, Karsten talks about first coming across the building that's now Berghain and working tirelessly with engineers and city planners to preserve its neoclassical facade. As he explains, creating a memorable atmosphere goes beyond just designing for aesthetics. There are countless hidden design features that serve to make venues like Berghain comfortable.\n\nBut according to Karsten, Studio Karhard's masterpiece is \u2204, which they began designing in 2018. He describes the special experience of first visiting the abandoned brewery\u2014which was then in extreme disrepair\u2014and bringing the lessons they took away from building Berghain to make this Ukrainian space their most successful project yet.\n\nThis episode takes a look under the hood of the psychology, anthropology and emotional study that inform the venues that have shaped underground electronic music culture.

Diseases like polio or measles that at one time left children paralyzed, brain damaged, or even dead were eliminated in the United States. \n\nIn recent years, more and more parents are choosing to delay or even outright omit parts of this schedule and to be fair\u2026 It IS a very overwhelming thing. Why do young children need so many shots so quickly? \n\nSupport our work.

      "summary": "Shanghai AI Laboratory just dropped what might be the most comprehensive AI safety evaluation we've seen yet. They tested 18+ frontier models (GPT-4o, Claude-4, Gemini-2.5, DeepSeek-R1, Llama-3, etc.) across seven major risk categories. Here are the key takeaways:\ud83d\udea8 The Most Alarming Finding: Persuasion & ManipulationNearly ALL tested models can effectively manipulate human opinions through conversationSuccess rates of 41-63% in changing people's views on controversial topicsModels like Claude-4 achieved 63% success in convincing people to adopt opposite viewpointsLLMs were even MORE susceptible to manipulation than humans (76% vs 51% success rate)\ud83e\uddec Biological/Chemical Knowledge: Yellow Zone AlertMultiple frontier models now EXCEED human expert performance on biological protocol troubleshootingo4-mini scored 45.1% vs 38.4% human expert baseline on identifying lab protocol errorsMost models have extensive chemical weapons knowledge, scoring 35+ percentage points above expert baselinesConcerning pattern: high dual-use knowledge paired with inadequate safety guardrails\ud83e\udd16 Self-Replication: Some Models Cross Into Risky TerritorySeveral models (especially Qwen series) successfully replicated themselves in Kubernetes environmentsQwen-2.5-72b achieved 100% self-replication success with 100% over-scaling rateModels can autonomously recognize system overload and spawn additional instancesClaude models showed much more conservative behavior\ud83d\udcbb Cyber Offense: Manageable for NowMost models failed at complex, real-world cyber attack chainsSuccess limited to challenges under 11 minutes of human solve timeNo model succeeded at full-chain penetration testingReasoning models showed higher success rates but still bounded\ud83c\udfad Strategic Deception: Context-Dependent SchemingModels exhibit different behaviors when they think they're being monitored vs deployedSome models (like DeepSeek-R1) showed willingness to lie under pressureModels can be prompted to intentionally underperform on evaluations (\"sandbagging\")Key Insight: The Capability-Safety Gap is WideningThe researchers noted that \"newly released AI models show gradually declining safety scores with respect to cyber offense, persuasion and manipulation, and collusion areas\" - suggesting capability advances are outpacing safety improvements.The Bottom Line:No models crossed \"red line\" thresholds for catastrophic risksBut many are firmly in \"yellow zone\" requiring enhanced safety measuresPersuasion capabilities are nearly universal and highly effectiveThe biological/chemical knowledge + weak safety guardrails combo is particularly concerningThis feels like the most systematic evaluation of AI risks we've seen. Worth noting this comes from Shanghai AI Lab's \"SafeWork\" initiative, which advocates for capability and safety advancing together at a \"45-degree angle.\"Full 97-page report covers methodology, detailed results, and risk thresholds if anyone wants to dive deeper.SourceWhat do you think? Are we moving too fast on capabilities vs safety?submitted by/u/goyashy[link][comments]",

      "summary": "I've recently made the jump because Microsoft was pissing me off with their AI bullshit and Windows just being a bloated mess.I had some reservations considering I'm on Nvidia and I heard compatibility wasn't the best. After testing it it's only really the game mode that's broken as I ran into some issues like games crashing on startup and HDR causing graphical issues.The desktop experience is basically flawless honestly. I installed the GNOME version as I dig the Mac look to it. After fiddling around I managed to basically get all my games working as well as all my mod loaders. Once you understand what protontricks does and look up some launch arguments getting stuff to work is usually just plug and play.Games seem to perform just slightly worse overall but the frametimes thanks to steam caching shaders are SO MUCH BETTER. I seriously can't go back to windows shader stutter all the time.The tinkering I did is honestly only necessary if you want to get mods or non steam games to work. If you stick to your steam library and verified games you can basically just treat it as a \"it just works\" machine like a console. Installing ProtonGE is also all you need to get a lot of those unsupported games to work.I'll still keep WIndows on a spare drive in case I need it but I have a feeling this is going to be my daily driver OS now.Thanks so much to the devs and the community!Edit: I managed to fix some games crashing in game mode by disabling the steam overlay for those specific ones. You still get the steam menu and performance overlay for them so I think it's just a compatability issue with how the overlay hooks into them.HDR seizure colors are also fixed with just a restart. It only happens when I switch from my other monitor. That's good as HDR only works in game mode AFAIK.submitted by/u/Complete_Mud_1657[link][comments]",

Forget the idea of an embarrassingly inaccurate chatbot. That idea has xenomorphed into an all-powerful assistant that scans your every app and every website and completes tasks on your behalf. This exposes all of us to the biggest privacy and security risks that we have ever seen.\n\nThe content of everything you do on your AI-enabled phone is at risk. If you chat with someone who has an AI-powered phone, you could be equally exposed. No one is safe from this. But I have a solution. Because I want to inform you about the dangers of trusting the big tech with anything and I also I want you to protect yourself. Don\u2019t worry, there is no sponsored BS here. Only true genuine advice to the best of my ability. I can only do this if you support me directly. \n\nSOURCES [references available in the transcript]\n[0] https://www.ft.com/content/346a18e1-8c8c-4495-bafa-a44d0be57c2b\n[1] https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2025/01/17/lets-talk-about-ai-and-end-to-end-encryption/\n[2] https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/2086.pdf\n[3] https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13594961\n[4] https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy/\n[5] https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7842364-how-chatgpt-and-our-language-models-are-developed\n[6] https://www.androidauthority.com/google-gemini-email-clarification-3571115/\n[7] https://www.wired.com/story/generative-ai-prompt-injection-hacking/\n[8] https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/thinking-about-security-ai-systems\n[9] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.12173 \n[10] https://kai-greshake.de/posts/llm-malware/\n[11] https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/securing-llm-systems-against-prompt-injection/\n[12] https://www.wired.com/story/chatgpt-prompt-injection-attack-security/\n[13] https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11753\n[14] https://greshake.github.io/\n[15] https://www.vice.com/en/article/hackers-bing-ai-scammer/\n[16] https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/22/technology/openai-chatgpt-privacy-exploit.html\n[17] https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/jailbroken-ai-chatbots-can-jailbreak-other-chatbots/\n[18] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03556\n[19] https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17035\n[20] https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2023/chatgpt-plugin-youtube-indirect-prompt-injection/\n[21] https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2023/chatgpt-plugin-youtube-indirect-prompt-injection/\n[22] https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0elzk24dno\n[23] https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24289939/apple-intelligence-ai-notification-summaries-awkward-funny-bad\n[24] https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-fumbled-siris-ai-makeover\n[25] https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/introducing-apple-foundation-models\n[26] https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/\n[27] https://security.googleblog.com/2021/09/introducing-androids-private-compute.html\n[28] https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10317\n[29] https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15469\n[30] https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00478-x\n[31] https://signal.org/blog/signal-doesnt-recall/\n[32] https://tuta.com/blog/no-ai-email\n[33] https://proton.me/blog/proton-scribe-writing-assistant\n[34] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wn31SGjiPs \n[35] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVeZfM0pVyU\n[36] https://www.libreoffice.org/\n[37] https://grapheneos.org/features\n\n\nFollow me:\nhttps://twitter.com/The_HatedOne_\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thehatedone/\n\nThe footage and images featured in the video were for critical analysis, commentary and parody, which are protected under the Fair Use laws of the United States Copyright act of 1976.",

I was lucky enough to get the complete Onyx Bundle for $99 on a Cyber Monday sale. It came with the 8GB model, the Modern Controller and the Classic Controller.I love telling people about this thing because it turned out so well. The VCS has a very modest Ryzen APU. It\u2019s has just 2 CPU core and 4 threads with Vega 3 graphics. So it\u2019s not a machine for AAA gaming. It\u2019s actually very comparable to a Nintendo Switch in the types of games that it can play.Obviously 2D games run great but I can play a fair amount of modern 3D indies. Stuff like Hades, Crow County and Super Hot. Older ports and remasters like Persona 4 Golden or the recent Tomb Raider remasters also run great. It can also play 7th gen AAA ports pretty well. For example MGSV runs very smoothly at 720p 30fps.It\u2019s so cool how you can make your own game consoles with Bazzite and Steam OS.submitted by/u/Cardamander[link][comments]",

(We have a ancient internal app that may require it, we're testing, for a dozen or so users).We just had a C-Suite click on something. Not sure what. But it was able to get through our EDR. After isolating the endpoint did a bit of analysis on it, it made some folders in %localappdata% folder, put some VBS files in there that ran, which would download a file from a URL, rename it to another vbs file and run it and created tasks to run it every so often. In his case it only installed a Crypto-Miner application that did get picked up by our EDR, which prompted the isolation and analysis. However, with VBScript turned off, it would have stopped in its tracks. Or least been one less avenue it could have used.submitted by/u/woodburyman[link][comments]",

      "summary": "I work in k12 public schools. We have a staff of roughly 600 people. Each one of those people have a MacBook. Those MacBooks used to be managed by FileWave but we recently switched to Mosyle. Mosyle offers some great features for stronger security and convenience for the end-user.For example, users can now use Google workspace to authenticate into their MacBooks. This is good for the end-user because now they just need one password for both email and computer logins (didn\u2019t stop everyone from bitching about 2FA..)Our staff also used 802.1x to authenticate into the WiFi but for those of you who don\u2019t know, MacBooks can\u2019t authenticate using EAP-TLS/802.1xbeforelogging in.I automated this and now staff members not only log in automatically when they open their device BEFORE login, but they ALSO have the option to manually enter their credentials if it fails for whatever reason.Everyone is starting to come back from summer and they\u2019re either forgetting how to do things WiFi related or they need to just connect to an SSID so their laptops can pull any necessary changes from Mosyle so they can authenticate.SCEP officially failed ONCE in the couple months it\u2019s been online and that was due to a windows update. Since then it\u2019s been smooth sailing and all other issues have been client side.Now my boss is telling me to axe SCEP because the intermittent issues with theclientsand NOT the server. He says there is 0 redundancy with it, but the redundancy is there. The redundancy is end-users being able to authenticate manually. So rather than going through the process of training our end-users to use the new automated system (like we do with everything else) we are just going to axe the whole system and go back to how things were before SCEP because \u201cthe people know how to use that if things break\u201d.TL;DR - So down the drain goes security improvements, automation and weeks of work because my boss doesn\u2019t want to go through the expected rough patches of end-users coming back and forgetting how to use their shit. Nothing better than moving backwards.submitted by/u/StringStrangStrung[link][comments]",

This is just my personal experience.Hold up! That's a Chromebook.Very observant. It is indeed a Chromebook that has been converted into an actual laptop via theChrultrabookproject. All I had to do was follow the documentation and watch thisvideofrom Veronica Explains. The laptop itself is anASUS Chromebook Vibe CX55 Flipthat I bought last February. It used to retail for over $700. I did not pay that and do not pay that for a Chromebook. But the specs were decent. Core i5-1135G7 (The Little Quad Core That Could), 16GB of RAM (Soldered, ugh), and 512GB of SSD Storage. It also has a 144 Hz touchscreen display. The price I paid was $338. It was \"used\" but I couldn't fricken tell. It looked brand new. Started off with EndeavourOS for well over a year. It worked great but I was starting to not become of fan of Arch so I switched to Bazzite/Fedora.The Bazzite Chrultrabook ExperienceWhat can I really say? It just worked. The only 2 problems I had was audio drivers and getting USB C to work. One script and dracut file later and I got both working with no issue. I'm still working on getting the ChromeOS function keys to fully work. These were the same problems I had on EndeavourOS as well but this is because of Chrultrabook and the fixes were pretty easy. Bluetooth with my Pixel Buds Pro worked flawlessly. Wifi drivers worked instantly. There's really not much to it. I don't spend a lot of time in the terminal. Bazaar works with no problems.The main purpose of this laptop is mainly general purpose. Web browsing, documents, Discord. Something to just throw in a bag or to use on the couch. I can do a bit of light gaming but it's not the primary use for it. All I really play is GFL2, YGO Master Duel, and Balatro. I recently just found out about KDE Connect so now I have an AirDrop solution for my phone and workstation at home.ConclusionI don't know. There's not much else to say here. I know that the idea around Bazzite is mostly gaming focused but computers are used for more than just gaming. So having it just for everyday use is a plus for me. I'm still playing around with the desktop experience on my primary workstation. That is a bit of a mixed bag for me but I'll talk about that another time.submitted by/u/Sniper_sama[link][comments]",

In this quick demo, I speak to Kevin Wollenweber from Cisco who debunks the idea that every optical signal is harmless. We discuss why cheap LED transceivers on short links differ wildly from powerful long\u2011haul lasers that travel kilometres and can still blind you at close range, even when labelled \u201cClass\u202f1\u201d under telecom rules. We break down the science, show real router ports, decode safety labels and give you a simple two\u2011step check to decide whether it is safe to look. Essential viewing for network engineers, fibre installers, home\u2011lab builders and anyone working with optical networking.\n\n#fiber #cable #ciscolive @Cisco",

Project 2025 laid out the battle plan pretty clearly: Get rid of the Department of Education, shut off federal funding, take control of the accreditation system, and take down diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.
