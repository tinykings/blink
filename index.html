‚ÄúFoundation‚Äù has captivated audiences with its intricate world-building, stunning visuals, bold storytelling, and compelling performances. Season 3 continues the epic chronicle of a band of exiles on their monumental journey to save humanity and rebuild civilization amid the fall of the Galactic Empire. 

Set 152 years after the events of Season 2, the Foundation has become increasingly established far beyond its humble beginnings while the Cleonic Dynasty‚Äôs Empire has dwindled. As both of these galactic powers forge an uneasy alliance, a threat to the entire galaxy appears in the fearsome form of a warlord known as ‚ÄúThe Mule‚Äù whose sights are set on ruling the universe by use of physical and military force, as well as mind control. It‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess who will win, who will lose, who will live, and who will die as Hari Seldon, Gaal Dornick, the Cleons, and Demerzel play a potentially deadly game of intergalactic chess.

<div id="summary-19" class="summary" style="display: none;">Hi Guys! I'm Manu from theEterspireteam. I'm super excited to share a big milestone that we've achieved in big part thanks to this sub's support: we've officially surpassed 200.000 registered players!When I made apost about hitting 100,000 accountsat the beginning of the year, I didn't, even in my wildest dreams, think that we would double that in less than six months. For a small team like ours, this feels like a huge achievement, and with our Steam and macOS releases just around the corner (September 15th), we hope to keep this growth streak going!I know there's a lot of discussion in this sub about what makes a game grow and get popular, so I thought this could be a good chance to share a bit of insight into what helped us get to 200k, and what didn't really:What helped:Regular updates:We've been releasingtwo updates a monthsince June 2024. Back then, our team was only five people, and the crunches and deadlines were honestly a bit crazy at the beginning, but once we got into a rhythm, we really understood the importance of a regular update schedule.We know there are several different models for updates in MMOs. Some games release big, all-encompassing updates as seasons or expansions, while others release small bugfix and balance patches with more regularity. In our case, we found that giving players new content and features to discover twice a month gave them a great excuse to hop back into the game, without resorting to the usual FOMO stuff like dailies/weeklies.Eterspire has updates around the 14th and 28th of each month.Before we adopted this schedule, players didn't really know what to expect from our updates, nor when to expect them. Once we had a regular schedule, we started seeing a gradual but very consistent increase in both new and returning players, since knowing there is always new content coming to the game in a couple of weeks is always a big draw.Community building and word of mouth:One of the big draws in Eterspire is the community. This isn't just my assumption; we've had hundreds of players tell us, through reviews and comments, how they got hooked because of the friendly players that helped them get started or because of a community event they found fun. Tons of players have told us how they started playing because of their friend group, or because their partner asked them to play with them.As our community grew bigger and we put more effort into nurturing and taking care of it, we understood one key principle: most of the time your players are better at selling your game than you are.Our community members usually do a better job at conveying the strengths of the game than we ever could!You can spend hours and hours thinking of the best way to convey your game, of the perfect gameplay video, or the most effective tagline. But all that can't hold a candle to a player genuinely recommending the game to their friend because they think it's fun. In the end, if you take care of your community, the community will take care of the game.Measuring and understanding what you measure:Getting players to download your game is only one part of the equation. Once they've downloaded it, there are several steps they must go through before they can be considered an active player. This is why it's so important to track and measure these steps and understand what you can do to make the process as seamless as possible.To give you an example, for a long time, we didn't pay much attention to our account creation process, as we thought it worked fine. After taking the time to measure and analyze this step, we found out that only about 60% of the users downloading our game were actually creating an account. We were quite baffled by this. We had never considered that we could be losing 40% of our users in such a simple part of the onboarding process.Something as simple as streamlining our first login menu improved our account creation rate by almost 50%!Knowing this, we focused on making the first couple of screens and options the player sees as simple and intuitive as possible, and wouldn't you know it, that percentage jumped from 60% to over 90%. Imagine the number of users that never would've gotten to see the actual game if we had never bothered to measure or look into that process!Learning to prioritize:One of the most difficult things when developing an MMORPG, especially as a small team, is deciding what features to develop and how to manage your time. There's a whole balancing act between what you personally want to see in the game, what the community is asking for, and what you think is going to keep the game growing.Initially, this was extremely hard for us. You only have so many hours in a day, and when you're a team of 3, 4, or 5, spending a day working on a feature that players won't end up using much, or that won't bring new players in, can be demoralizing.Things got a lot better once we understood that before we begin work on any content or feature, we need a clear idea of what it accomplishes, what players will get out of it, and how it meshes with the rest of the game's progression. It's not enough that something sounds fun or it's been requested by some players; it has to have a clear objective that makes it worth the time we will spend developing it.Over time, this meant that players had more interesting and useful things to do in-game, and we had more time to work on the stuff that really matters, which, as our team grew, allowed us to work on bigger and bigger features!What didn't really helpAdsWhile online ads are usually a big part of player acquisition for most MMORPGs, we've had mixed results with them. Initially, we didn't have a budget to run them, and when we could finally afford to do so, they didn't really work like we expected them to.Our ads did bring in a lot of players, especially compared to the numbers we had previously, but we found that the players that came from ads weren't really staying for long or engaging with the community. We even did polls and surveys to find out how our most engaged players found out about Eterspire, and ads were one of the least picked answers!We were even more surprised when, after several months of running ad campaigns, we did a test to see what would happen if we turned them off. We did have some weeks with lower numbers, but after that, our new players per day began steadily growing, and these players were staying. Store algorithms began showing us to players that vibed a lot better with our game, we started showing up much higher in search results, and word of mouth improved a lot!It seemed like while ads brought a lot of raw numbers, the number of actual engaged players that came from them was comparatively small. Our big takeaway here is that Eterspire is a game that does much better organically and through recommendations than with big ad campaigns and calls to action.----Well, that's all I have to share today. I hope this post sheds a bit of light on what developing an MMORPG is like! If you guys have any questions about the game or our development process, I'd be happy to answer you in the comments :)submitted by/u/Reasonable_Wish_6022[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-20" class="summary" style="display: none;">This isn‚Äôt your typical tech news roundup. In this video, we break down four massive stories from July that signal a major shift in how AI will shape our lives...from what we wear, to how we work, to the policies that govern it.

Here‚Äôs what happened:

üï∂Ô∏è Meta‚Äôs Superintelligence Lab
Mark Zuckerberg just announced a $110 billion push to bring AI into your everyday life. Starting with smart glasses that act like a personal assistant. With talent from OpenAI and Scale AI leading the charge, Meta is going all-in on AI.

üá∫üá∏ The U.S Government's ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs AI Action Plan‚Äù
The U.S. government released its most aggressive national AI strategy yet... focusing on speed, infrastructure, and ideology. From banning ‚Äúwoke AI‚Äù in federal use to prioritizing open-source models and deregulated development, this could shape AI‚Äôs trajectory for years.

ü§ñ ChatGPT Gets Agency
OpenAI gave ChatGPT the ability to take real-world actions: browse the web, send emails, even run code. This moves us into the era of agentic AI where AI doesn‚Äôt just answer your questions, it takes initiative.

üöó Tesla‚Äôs $16.5B Chip Deal with Samsung
Tesla signed a multi-billion dollar deal to manufacture custom AI chips with Samsung in Texas. These chips will power everything from Full Self-Driving to the Optimus robot, making Tesla not just a car company, but a full-stack AI player.</div>

<div id="summary-22" class="summary" style="display: none;">I have to say, it is really not funny in real life. Like holy F@#$2...He is a micromanager who is not a manager.he has the type of mindset that if you don't do it his way, you are doing it wrong.you could do 95% of the work, and he will come over adjust some cables, adjust a some monitors, take a picture of the setup, and in his head he basically did the work (even tho no one ask him to do so)Brother would start to update random confluence pages on Saturday and Sunday.he would be creeping on everyone's ticket in the ticket queue.He assigns tickets to you without asking or telling you if you have the time.He is the type of person that if you were to make a mistake, even tho you fixed it before it affected any users, he would tell the manager in order to get good boy points.Mind you, it is not like this guy is some IT god that would solve any issues or would get to the solution that no one could think of. His IT knowledge is on par with the rest of the team.Our manager is chill in the sense that as long as you do your tickets and work on your project, he is not on top of you, but on the other hand, this guy always tries to pseudo-manage people.I already confirmed this is not a me thing, and the other guys think the same thing.I'm not a confrontational type of person, but this guy is getting to me; I'm about to start shit. I just want to rant a bit because it is starting to frustrate me.Update: I forgot to add, based on his personality, I'm 100% sure that he is aiming to be the next in line for the manager position, so my fear is that anything I say or do could come back to bite me.submitted by/u/shiraco415[link][comments]</div>

if younger me (college student dating someone working full time) came up to me for advice i would tell her to absolutely tf NOT offer to split every single expense in the relationship

2) I think it‚Äôs ok to not offer to split on a first date. I obviously am always grateful and say ty!! if we end up getting dessert, i would be more than happy to grab that but no more performative purse searching and wallet grabbing!!!!

From the psychedelic swirl of the 60s to the slow, bass-heavy haze of modern hip hop, cannabis has quietly shaped the sonic landscape for over half a century. But how exactly does a plant influence production choices, vocal styles, even the tempo of entire genres?
This is the story of how weed became an invisible co-producer‚Äîfrom The Beatles to Snoop Dogg, from rock to trap‚Äîand how you can still hear its fingerprints in the music of today. It‚Äôs about altered states, slowed-down beats, and what creativity sounds like when your mind is somewhere else entirely.

<div id="summary-27" class="summary" style="display: none;">I played Battlefield 6 for 4 hours, and I‚Äôm honestly shocked by how good it is. Huge maps, tight gunplay, true squad coordination this feels like the Battlefield we've been waiting for. In this preview, I break down the gameplay, destruction, vehicles, and why I think this could finally be the comeback DICE needs.

EA invited me to join the event and covered my Uber to and from the Venue. I also ate a bunch of chips.

The Presidential Fitness Test for American schoolchildren was created back in 1966, and required kids to do sit-ups, push-ups, pull-ups and the one-mile run as part of a test in school gym classes.

The program changed during the Obama administration to focus more on individual health, but President Trump says it's time to bring it back.</div>

<div id="summary-46" class="summary" style="display: none;">Please, please, ignore the fact we're still running Access 97 for now please. I need a better way of getting this bullshit deployed silently.. Right now I have just about everything automated but this stupid thing I can't figure out. Takes a decent amount of time to get it to actually work on Windows 11.Finding documentation from before 2005 is a nightmare. I try to install "Microsoft Network Installation Wizard 2.1" and it just refuses to read any .LST or .STF files I throw at it saying its not from a "post-admin network image". What does that even mean?We're a small company and our dev team sucks. Our 15+ year DBA refuses to touch his precious ancient SQL servers to update the database to something more sane. No one else can do his job so here I am with this shit.6 years ago we hired a new CTO who blew millions of dollars on a rebuild of the entire application in Azure. It failed spectacularly, never worked at all, and now the whole company is scrambling to make sales and polish up this old turd of an application that runs on old SQL code and has our internal users still interacting with it on Access 97.submitted by/u/shmehh123[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-47" class="summary" style="display: none;">A few months ago, I shared on this sub how I made my first game ever, an iOS-only idle clicker game calledCookie Empire: Idle Clicker.It's obviously inspired by the famous Cookie Clicker, which is unfortunately not available for iOS just yet. There are many other idle clickers out there, so I‚Äôm trying hard to avoid the usual traps: forced ads, pay-to-win balance, confusing UI, and shallow mechanics. I'm doing an honest effort to make a good game. A game that's fun, fair and still profitable. I bounce most ideas withthis amazing Discord community, in which we discuss balancing, bugs, new features, and roadmap. We're nearly at 1000 members!So far, I'm proud of the game including these features: - No game-interrupting ads - Offline play - More than 50+ unique buildings- Gardening minigame - Stock market simulator minigame - Lucky Wheel minigame - Ascension mechanics - A "sacrifice grandmas and feed their souls to japanese demons while you keep falling to the depths of hell" mechanic - Coins are the reward from minigames, which can be exchanged for Cookies - 3 Public leaderboards with different objectivesRecent updates to the game, most of them coming from the Discord community: - Different types of Magic Cookies - More "Revelations" with synergistic effects - New Cookie skins - Swipe-to-harvest for the Garden minigame.Flaws I'm actively working on: - Performance isn't great. When you're in the late game and have a gazillion buildings, power-ups, magic cookies and things going on, the phone's battery gets drained pretty fast. I need to get better at this - Collecting offline idle production requires watching one ad (or buying one IAP that unlocks it forever). This is the main driver of revenue, but also the most controversial bit of the game. I know now the expectation in these games is for offline production to be free and having an opt-in ad to double/triple it. I'm testing out how to change and fix this.This keeps being a work in progress, as always. I'm pushing new updates almost every week and spending every bit of free time I've got into making this game better. Your feedback is extremely useful and really helps me out. Sometimes it stings, but I really use it to get better as a developer and make the game better.submitted by/u/mrknoot[link][comments]</div>

Thanks for being here.

<div id="summary-52" class="summary" style="display: none;">This is my second attempt at sharing this post so I'm first posting in it another related subreddit. My initial submission to the Apple Arcade subreddit wasn‚Äôt approved by the moderators. I reached out to them for clarification didn't receive a response, so I‚Äôm still unsure why it was declined. That said, the content below is identical to what I originally posted, aside from this introductory paragraph. I‚Äôll try cross-posting to the Apple Arcade subreddit again and hope the moderators will approve it this time.I really hoped Apple would follow its ‚ÄúThink Different‚Äù philosophy, one that has inspired creatives and curious minds for decades, and shaped its product design strategy.But today, the reality is disappointing: we have a dedicated casino games category and ads all over the App Store. The service they pitched as a paradigm shift for gaming on Apple platforms has turned into a dumping ground for hyper-casual, low-complexity, addiction-driven games. It feels completely at odds with the values that made Apple a truly special company.submitted by/u/SquirrelBlue135[link][comments]</div>

Street of Dreams is an unfinished documentary film about the musician Tiny Tim and the 1979 Ghost Train fire at Luna Park Sydney, directed and produced by Australian artist Martin Sharp. The film first features Tiny Tim, showcasing footage of his record-setting, two-hour-and-seventeen-minute professional singing marathon at Luna Park Sydney in January 1979. It tells Tiny's life story, framed around the marathon performance footage, while highlighting his many eccentricities, religious convictions and others hangups as captured by Sharp's camera crews in both Australia and the United States.</div>

<p class="published-date">2025-08-01 13:00:01</p>
<p class="feed-title">Living Big In A Tiny House</p>
<button class="toggle-summary-btn" data-target="summary-67">...</button>
<div id="summary-67" class="summary" style="display: none;">Step inside this absolutely breathtaking modern tiny home set deep in the heart of the Australian rainforest. Here amongst the towering trees, tiny house magic has been created!  Built by superyacht captain Johny, this stunning rainforest tiny house is a personal paradise, designed as the ultimate retreat from the world. When he's not sailing the globe with the rich and famous, Johny returns to this peaceful sanctuary to surf, recharge, and reconnect with nature.

The home itself is a masterclass in tiny house design. With a single-level layout and a focus on openness and flow, it makes the most of its lush surroundings. Massive picture windows bring the forest inside, creating a seamless connection to the outdoors. The home feels expansive, calm, and deeply rooted in its environment.

Outside, the landscaping is equally as impressive. A generous deck expands the living area into the forest, while natural elements like boulders and large timber logs have been thoughtfully placed to ground the home in the landscape. It‚Äôs the perfect blend of modern design and raw, untamed nature.

This is a tiny home that you won't want to miss. We absolutely loved getting to visit this rainforest retreat and share Johny‚Äôs incredible story with you. We hope you enjoy the tour as much as we did.

<div id="summary-69" class="summary" style="display: none;">Nintendo is joining the crows and raising prices on old hardware. The base Switch is now estimated to cost $299 without a bundled game, and prices are going up across the board on older models and accessories. This comes after similar moves by Xbox and PlayStation in other territories but now we can add Nintendo‚Äôs case to the list :/

But today, these breakout stars have two choices: Tell the truth, or suffer the wrath of the Last Dab. Whoever eats the most wings, loses!

From Jake trying dishes from his "things I don't like list," to revealing embarrassing overshares, these two will either need to be honest, or go head-to-head with the Wings of Death. Can Jake rank his fellow podcast hosts from best to worst? Will Coco reveal which city she's least excited to perform for? Tune in to an all-new episode of Hot Ones Versus, and see who takes home the golden chicken wing trophy!

<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/qpDJFFlEpFg" target="_blank">Poll: Most adults plan to skip COVID shot this fall</a></h2>

<div id="summary-96" class="summary" style="display: none;">According to a new poll from the health research group KFF, most adults in the U.S. don‚Äôt plan to get another COVID-19 shot this fall, and many are confused about new federal vaccine policies.

More than 1,200 adults were surveyed in July; 59% said they do not expect to get a COVID vaccine this fall. Older adults and Democrats were most likely to say they want another shot. Most Republicans say they don‚Äôt. Many parents also said they‚Äôre confused about whether the vaccines are still recommended for children.

The Trump administration has narrowed who‚Äôs eligible for the shots ‚Äî to people age 65 and older and younger people with other health problems. Federal officials recommend that parents should talk to their doctors before vaccinating their kids.</div>

Doug Jung serves as showrunner and executive produces along with Sibbett, Peter Chernin, Jenno Topping, Tracey Cook and Brian Mendoza. Justin Chon directs the first two episodes and serves as executive producer. Anders Engstrom, Jim Rowe, Molly Allen, Francis Lawrence and Tim Van Patten also serve as executive producers. Grammy and Academy Award winning composer, Hans Zimmer wrote the theme music and co-produced the score for all nine episodes with composer, James Everingham, during his tenure with Bleeding Fingers Music, the multiple Emmy Award-winning and BAFTA-nominated composer collective co-founded by Zimmer in 2013.

<div id="summary-106" class="summary" style="display: none;">So this is happening. Our "trusted" integration partner just went radio silent three weeks before go-live, their project manager isn't returning calls, and I'm pretty sure they've moved on to easier clients. Cool. Cool cool cool.Context: I'm the IT director at a 200-bed hospital and we've been trying to replace our patient portal that literally still uses Flash. I know, I KNOW. Don't @ me. We got funding approved last year after our patient satisfaction scores tanked because people couldn't even log in to see their test results half the time.Found this vendor who promised seamless Epic integration, showed us these beautiful demos, the whole nine yards. Signed a contract in January, paid the first milestone payment, and everything seemed legit. Their team was responsive, they knew all the right FHIR buzzwords, even had references from other health systems.Then reality hit. The API calls started timing out randomly. Patient data was syncing but missing critical fields. Their "certified Epic integration" turned out to be a bunch of custom middleware that broke every time Epic pushed an update. When I asked about it, suddenly their developer who "built similar solutions for Mayo Clinic" was always in meetings.Last month they missed two major deadlines. When I finally got their PM on the phone, he basically admitted they'd never actually integrated with our version of Epic before and were "figuring it out as we go." That's when I started drinking at lunch.Three weeks ago: complete silence. Emails bouncing back. Phone goes straight to voicemail. I'm starting to think they just took our money and bailed.Meanwhile, my CEO is asking for status updates, our chief medical officer is making jokes about our "state-of-the-art 1990s technology," and I've got 50 physicians who were promised a working patient portal by next month.I'm sitting here at 11 PM googling "how to build Epic integration from scratch"...Anyone know a good therapist who specializes in IT trauma? Asking for a friend who is definitely me....submitted by/u/Tiny_Habit5745[link][comments]</div>

After this time, applications and devices will no longer be able to use Basic auth as an authentication method and must use OAuth when using SMTP AUTH to send email....The only remediation for this is to update your client or app to support OAuth, use a different client or app that supports OAuth, or use a different email solution such as High Volume Email or Azure Communication Services for Email.Primarily concerned about scan to email, as well as some various apps set up to do email reporting on my end.submitted by/u/01101110011O1111[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-114" class="summary" style="display: none;">The UK‚Äôs Online Safety Act just went into effect and VPN downloads are surging. ProtonVPN soared to #1 in the App Store after a staggering 1,400% increase in UK signups. In this video, I break down what‚Äôs happening, why people are turning to VPNs to protect their identity and bypass invasive age verification checks, and why I recommend ProtonVPN over less secure alternatives.

In this video, we explain Sam Altman‚Äôs comments on ChatGPT privacy, show Proton LUMO, and compare how a zero-access, open source, European-hosted assistant treats your data. We also cover Proton VPN, cash and crypto payments, and why UK age-verification rules are driving signups.

<div id="summary-119" class="summary" style="display: none;">I'm scanning my brain inside a plane that‚Äôs about to be hurtling toward the ground. Here's why... 

It tests the effects of zero gravity on the brain, specifically, how well you can tell if stuff is upright or not! Which is really important for doing delicate experiments in space‚Ä¶ 

You put your head in this hole and watch a screen with this little line on it. Every time it changes, you have to hit a button to say whether you think it‚Äôs vertical or tilted. It‚Äôs surprisingly hard!

But this task is special...

Experiments like this are giving us valuable data for a future where humans are living long term in space.

In this video, we break down how to use social media without revealing your real identity. We‚Äôll walk through how to understand your threat model, avoid common mistakes, and build a pseudonymous identity that actually protects you.

Whether you're just trying to keep your boss out of your business or avoid serious profiling, we‚Äôll help you match your privacy tactics to your risk level, step by step.

Achieving basic pseudonymity online is much easier than it sounds, and you absolutely have the power to reclaim it. Start from wherever you are. Every step you take makes a difference.

Happy August 1st! Crazy how fast the year‚Äôs flying by. üò≠

I wanted to share a few techy / desk setup‚Äìy things I do as a creator at the start of every month.

Realigning with myself (both as a solo creator and a creative) is how I stay grounded and ready for whatever‚Äôs next.

I hope this gives you ideas on how to build your own monthly rituals. Save this for later, or send it to someone who might need it. üíæ‚¨áÔ∏è

<div id="summary-136" class="summary" style="display: none;">"I combine my language with hip-hop so that, via hip-hop, my culture could continue living," says Eber Quisbert, a 40-year-old Bolivian rapper. Quisbert performs with his mentee and fellow Bolivian rapper, Carlos Orellana, 26, whose stage name is Andes Mc. The performers mix Spanish lyrics with Quechua and Aymara, two indigenous languages.

One of the songs they performed, "Jina Jina Mayma," tells the story of tensions between Bolivia's indigenous regions, blending their Quechua and Guarani languages. The title means "Let's go, everyone."

"We created a song like this because everyone just wants to live peacefully," Quisbert recalls. His lyrics aim to inspire unity and peace: "I'm from here, you're from there. Let's join hands, ready to move forward. Shout for liberty to the beat of equality. Leave behind prejudice, we are just one."</div>

fal is a generative media platform. They just raised their Series C round of $125M, which values them at a $1.5B valuation.

In 2020, during the COVID bubble in Palm Springs, two Turkish engineers ‚Äì one from Amazon, one from Coinbase ‚Äì started exploring startup ideas together. Starting with just image models when everyone said the market was too small, they stuck to their vision while competitors chased LLMs. They foresaw the video revolution coming. They obsessed over speed, becoming #1 on every benchmark.

From two Turkish immigrants to a billion-dollar AI unicorn ‚Äì this is their story.

In the first season of The Buccaneers, a group of fun-loving young American girls exploded into the tightly corseted London of the 1870s ‚Ä¶ setting hearts racing and kicking off an Anglo-American culture clash. Now the Buccaneers are no longer the invaders ‚Äî England is their home. In fact, they‚Äôre practically running the place. Nan is the Duchess of Tintagel, the most influential woman in the country. Conchita is Lady Brightlingsea, heroine to a wave of young American heiresses. And Jinny is on every front page, wanted for the kidnapping of her unborn child. All of the girls have been forced to grow up and now have to fight to be heard, as they wrestle with romance, lust, jealousy, births and deaths ‚Ä¶ themes consuming all women of any age, no matter what year it is. Last time we got a taste of England. This time we‚Äôre in for a veritable feast.

Written by series creator Katherine Jakeways, season two is directed by BAFTA Award winner William McGregor, DGA Award winner Rachel Leiterman, John Hardwick and Charlie Manton. Jakeways, BAFTA Award nominee Beth Willis and BAFTA Award winner Susanna White serve as executive producers. ‚ÄúThe Buccaneers‚Äù is produced for Apple TV+ by The Forge Entertainment, a Banijay UK company.

You move the email out of the spam box, back into inbox, and it goes back to spam a few seconds later he says.That's odd, our mail rule that sets internal to internal at SCL level -1 or whatever is a thing. Run a trace, delivered normally. KQL query - delivered normally. Not junk. Not ignore conversation feature. No block list. No mailbox rules. No Outlook plugins.I finally remote in because he's not on a job site. It's going to a folder literally called "spambox"We don't have anything that does that. Ask AI because I'm so done with this shit at this point.Day 3 of trying to figure this shit out.IT WAS HIS ****ING SAMSUNG MAIL APP ON HIS PHONE.Which we don't allow people to use because it doesn't work. We tell them to use the Outlook App, which is probably renamed Copilot AI Mail Extreme Edition X .NET Copilot Edition by now.FML I need a smoke break.

Invasion follows an alien invasion through different perspectives around the world.  In season three, those perspectives collide for the first time, as the series‚Äô main characters are brought together to work as a team on a critical mission to infiltrate the alien mothership. The ultimate apex aliens have finally emerged, rapidly spreading their deadly tendrils across our planet. It will take all our heroes working together, using all their experience and expertise, to save our species. New relationships are formed, old relationship are challenged and even shattered, as our international cast of characters must become a team before it‚Äôs too late. 

The third season of Invasion stars returning cast members Golshifteh Farahani, Shioli Kutsuna, Shamier Anderson, India Brown, Shane Zaza, Enver Gjokaj, and introduces new series regular Erika Alexander.

Invasion is created by Kinberg and Weil, who also serve as executive producers alongside Audrey Chon, David Witz, Alik Sakharov, Dan Dietz, Katie O‚ÄôConnell Marsh and Nick Nantell.

I built a tool that dynamically creates Infinite focus music that adapts to what's on your screen.

By combining a few locally-run Open-Source AI models (MagentaRT + InternVL3), it's trivial to have your own contextual, endless radio station.

Plus, I also go over some music model glitch token behavior; with absolutely terrifying results.

<div id="summary-189" class="summary" style="display: none;">Governments are pushing age verification laws that force you to upload a passport, driver‚Äôs-licence selfie or credit-card scan just to access platforms like Reddit, X (Twitter), BlueSky or Xbox Live. I unpack why this ‚Äúsafety‚Äù measure is a privacy nightmare.
We review the 59 GB Tea app breach that dumped women‚Äôs IDs, selfies and 1.1 million private messages online, plus the 15 billion credentials logged on Have I Been Pwned?. You‚Äôll see how third-party vendors such as Persona store UK citizens‚Äô data on US servers, creating cross-border exposure the moment a hacker breaks in.

That's why we are super excited to share this ingenious kitchen tool. The Cuisine Art Freeze Wand. It's basically meal prep but for homemade ice cream! You add the ingredients to the tubs ahead of time, great for fruit that's about to go bad or if you have an abundance of raspberries or black berries you can't pick quick enough. 

We have a COUPON CODE for 20% off a Freeze Wand until August 4th!

<div id="summary-197" class="summary" style="display: none;">Fermented Watermelon Punch! üçâ
We bought a giant ‚Ç¨20 watermelon and turned it into the most refreshing naturally fizzy punch using wild fermentation!

We ended up with over 5 litres of juice, and that was with leftover chunks! After straining out the fibre, we poured it into a big glass jar and added:
Organic lemonsChopped organic appleA handful of fresh mint

These help kickstart the wild fermentation ‚Äî the natural yeasts on the fruit skins do all the magic. A few days later, we strained out the fruit, bottled it, and let it fizz up for another couple of days.

The result? A naturally carbonated, tangy-sweet, probiotic-rich watermelon punch!

‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨ Video Overview ‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨
In this video, I'll walk you through my product design process, showcasing the key tools and apps at each stage. I'll demonstrate how I use sketching tools, Fusion 360 for 3D modeling, and Cinema 4D for rendering to create industrial-inspired designs. You'll also see how I leverage Figma for design documentation, Adobe Illustrator for packaging, and my complete setup for product photography and marketing videos.

At the end, you'll see the projects I've been working on over the past year: the Industrial Series. This includes the Encore Series 3 keyboard I designed with Mode and a new line of precision-machined pens with Inventery. Both products are an extension of my original ‚ÄúX-Ray Collection‚Äù, which uses translucent polycarbonate that reveals internal components, complemented by premium materials like brushed steel and copper.

<div id="summary-213" class="summary" style="display: none;">So today, one of our beloved domain controller decided to nosedive during Windows Update.A collegue informed me about it because he noticed that a backup plan stopped working for this server.I log in to investigate and am greeted by this gem:The paging file is too small for this operation to complete.Huh.Open Event Viewer - Event ID 2004 - Resource Exhaustion Detector shouting into the void. Turns out:MsSense.exe: 12.7GBMsMpEng.exe: 3.3GBupdater.exe: 1.6GBTotal: roughly more than three times what the box even had.Cool cool. So how much RAM does this DC have?4GB. FOUR. On a domain controller. Running Defender for Endpoint.Just when I think "surely the pagefile saved it," I run:Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_PageFileSettingAnd there it is:MaximumSize : 0 Name : D:\pagefile.sysZERO.Zero kilobytes of coping mechanism. On D:.Which isn‚Äôt even the system volume.It's like giving someone a thimble of water and telling them to run a marathon in July.Anyway, i rebooted it out of pure spite. It came back. Somehow.Meanwhile i've created a task for the datacenter responsibles like:Can we please stop bullshitting and start fixing our base configs?submitted by/u/Funkenzutzler[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-222" class="summary" style="display: none;">In this week‚Äôs episode, we visit a 60 sqm apartment in Tanjong Pagar, one of Singapore‚Äôs oldest neighbourhoods known for its hawker centre and historic shophouses. Originally built in the 1970s, the apartment has been reconfigured from a two-bedroom layout into a single-bedroom home with an open-plan living area. The design blends nostalgia with a minimalist approach, using natural textures such as grey stone flooring, warm wood cabinetry and limewashed walls to bring a renewed sense of life to the old unit.

Architect Caroline Duncan's compact apartment is bright, flexible and full of custom DIY solutions and  smart storage. Thoughtful, inventive details include a customised Muji bench that provides both window seating and hidden storage, a modular felt sofa that easily converts into a bed, and a cat-friendly laundry nook that discreetly houses a litter box. The kitchen is a seamless blend of high and low, combining IKEA carcasses with bespoke birch plywood fronts and porcelain handles inherited from family. A full-height storage wall cleverly unifies the kitchen and wardrobe space while concealing a mirrored door to the bedroom. Subtle multifunctionality is scattered through-out the home: a recessed headboard niche doubles as a projector shelf, and a wall-mounted desk preserves the openness of the living space.

<div id="summary-237" class="summary" style="display: none;">I'm really wrestling with a directive from HR. They want to implement employee monitoring software for our hundreds of remote employees. The biggest headache is doing this without a massive backlash. I'm thinking about solutions that allow for silent, automated install. It's not only solid activity monitoring software and app and website tracking we need but also something easy to manage at scale for remote team management. Any thoughts on how to pull this off without causing a panic? Or pitfalls to avoid for workforce analytics at this scale? Thanks.submitted by/u/Expert-Economics-723[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-241" class="summary" style="display: none;">In the past there has been back and forth about this with people in smaller shops having one opinion and people in the large shops having another, and we definitely have our share of issues in the large enterprise, but I can say we do not have the following problems I see popping up here all the time.Secretary storing stuff in the network closed?Nope. Only authorized IT contacts have keys and policy forbids storage in network closets.Boss demands to have a list of everyone's passwords.Nope. Nobody can have anyone else's password by policy. Doing so would result in termination. No boss can override thisRandom desktop on a shelf in the data centerNope. Desktop computers are not allowed in the data center. Period.25 year old desktop with NT4 running the voicemail system in a closetNope. This would be a massive violation of the information security policy.Boss doesn't like MFA and forces you to turn it off for his accountNope. Information security policy requires everyone have MFA no matter who they are.A manager wants access to a former employee's email account and then starts sending email as them for months on endNope. If an employee leaves it requires multiple approvals including HR to get access to their email account, and only for long enough to copy the mail out and then it is closed down again. Old accounts can not be kept open indefinitely. Business process needs to be built around this because when people leave their accounts are absolutely deleted after a grace period.The finance lady insists she must have her own personal printer and the boss says to give it to herNope. There is no "finance lady" because finance is an entire department staffed by employees who have to operate as employees like everyone else and use the same equipment as everyone else. They can use secure release on the same printers as everyone else.It isn't all sunshine and roses by any means but we don't do a bunch of stupid nonsense that is just blatantly awful. There are no hubs under desks and servers in the bathroom. The microwave is not an IT responsibility. IT does not assemble furniture. We have a standard replacement cycle for our laptops every 3-4 years. Nobody has a gaming PC on their desk because they think they're special. Random non-technical executives do not have domain admin access just because they want it.We have a whole host of other issues, but at least we have none of these problems.submitted by/u/crankysysadmin[link][comments]</div>

‚ÄúFoundation‚Äù has captivated audiences with its intricate world-building, stunning visuals, bold storytelling, and compelling performances. Season 3 continues the epic chronicle of a band of exiles on their monumental journey to save humanity and rebuild civilization amid the fall of the Galactic Empire. 

Set 152 years after the events of Season 2, the Foundation has become increasingly established far beyond its humble beginnings while the Cleonic Dynasty‚Äôs Empire has dwindled. As both of these galactic powers forge an uneasy alliance, a threat to the entire galaxy appears in the fearsome form of a warlord known as ‚ÄúThe Mule‚Äù whose sights are set on ruling the universe by use of physical and military force, as well as mind control. It‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess who will win, who will lose, who will live, and who will die as Hari Seldon, Gaal Dornick, the Cleons, and Demerzel play a potentially deadly game of intergalactic chess.

üéß About This Video
Vampire Weekend is one of the only bands in history to land three #1 albums on the Billboard 200‚Ä¶ without ever landing a single on the Hot 100. Not even A-Punk. In a music industry driven by hits, charts and TikTok virality, how did this band build a career entirely around albums? And what does that say about the way we measure success in music today?

I‚Äôm breaking down the paradox at the heart of Vampire Weekend‚Äôs career: from Contra to Modern Vampires to Only God Was Above Us and exploring how they‚Äôve stayed true to album-first artistry in a singles-first world.

<div id="summary-301" class="summary" style="display: none;">North Korea just siphoned 17 million dollars through U-S remote jobs.

This video shows how U-S citizen Christina Chapman stockpiled laptops so DPRK workers could masquerade as Americans, win remote IT roles, and defraud 309 U-S companies, including many Fortune 500 firms, plus two abroad. Using 68 stolen identities, the ring moved millions before Chapman received a 102-month federal sentence.

<div id="summary-311" class="summary" style="display: none;">This beautifully designed mouse helped me gain some MMR üí•

The AX5 Pro from @mchose_official pulls off a unique exoskeleton-inspired design with sacrificing comfort or performance. It‚Äôs a super lightweight gaming-focused mouse, with a smooth glide and a fast polling rate. To be honest, I‚Äôm just a sucker for its unique design. But I‚Äôm certain that gamers who want to climb fast are going to appreciate its ergonomic grip, and its responsive and light nature.

This must be my current favorite gaming mouse atm.

All these systems feed us the IPs and other information to track the users but it's passive and we would have to check individual records.Any software in the market that will help us achieve this tracking request?Thanks in advance fellow sysadminsEdit: Just want to say thank you so much fellow sysadmins, Y'all are life savers.submitted by/u/186notout[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-325" class="summary" style="display: none;">From and To are the same user (someone in our org), a spoof. Subject are all juicy phishing subjects. docx, pdf, svg attachments. Document files have QR codes that are likely going to compromise users. Just got off a call with MS support. They stated "We have been seeing this for 2 months or so". No announcements, no further information. Seems like an open zero day being leveraged. We don't host an MX with microsoft's fallback domain. We don't allow relaying from outside of our network on our SMTP relay. Really stumped on this one. Microsoft said "Submit these messages to us and we will fix it on the back end". Seems very suspicious. The tech assisting us even possibly pretended to not know the term zero day. Almost like they were instructed to not admit to a zero day.Update: Thanks everyone for your engagement on this post. As for my case, I think I can disable Direct Send for my environment. We are not sending mail directly to microsoft, everything goes through our gateway. Someone mentioned "connectors bypass Direct Send" and that's all I needed to know.Update 2: We disabled Direct Send today. We just had to make sure we had our connectors to and from our gateway configured properly. So far, things are working great and any Direct Send emails are just being rejected.Update 3: We believe we have mitigated all the emails that are sent From and To the same person within our org. However, we are now noticing what seems to be some emails coming from another domain into our org using microsoft's infrastructure even though we have Direct Send disabled and all mail coming from other domains are supposed to go to the gateway.submitted by/u/jaychinut[link][comments]</div>

‚ÄúFoundation‚Äù has captivated audiences with its intricate world-building, stunning visuals, bold storytelling, and compelling performances. Season 3 continues the epic chronicle of a band of exiles on their monumental journey to save humanity and rebuild civilization amid the fall of the Galactic Empire. 

Set 152 years after the events of Season 2, the Foundation has become increasingly established far beyond its humble beginnings while the Cleonic Dynasty‚Äôs Empire has dwindled. As both of these galactic powers forge an uneasy alliance, a threat to the entire galaxy appears in the fearsome form of a warlord known as ‚ÄúThe Mule‚Äù whose sights are set on ruling the universe by use of physical and military force, as well as mind control. It‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess who will win, who will lose, who will live, and who will die as Hari Seldon, Gaal Dornick, the Cleons, and Demerzel play a potentially deadly game of intergalactic chess.

<div id="summary-371" class="summary" style="display: none;">This is a sleeping bag that sucks blood away from your brain! And they're making it into pants... 

On earth, gravity helps your blood naturally circulate away from your brain. But in zero G, your blood isn‚Äôt getting pulled away from your head anymore.

Astronauts say being in Zero G feels like you‚Äôre being hung slightly upside down. 

So scientists are experimenting with using negative pressure to pull your blood away from your brain. The goal is to eventually turn this bag version into a pair of pants.

Astronauts in the future could put these blood-sucking anti-gravity pants on and help their brains feel like they‚Äôre still on Earth.

<div id="summary-377" class="summary" style="display: none;">I'm an IT asset manager for a mid-size healthcare tech company. We recently acquired a smaller firm (about 100 remote staff) that operates on a tight budget and issues Chromebooks instead of full desktop setups. Their provisioning costs are around $700 per user (Chromebook + basic accessories), compared to our standard $2,000 setups (PC/Mac + dual monitors, dock, wireless peripherals).Here‚Äôs the issue: the acquired company pays new hires in the range of $12‚Äì$15/hour, and we‚Äôve had a wave of "ghost hires"‚Äîpeople who accept the job, sign onboarding forms acknowledging their responsibility for the equipment, receive a new Chromebook and monitor by the end of the week‚Ä¶ and never show up on Monday. No login, no reply to texts or automated emails, no returns. They just reset the Chromebook and keep it.Because these Chromebooks aren't enrolled in Google Admin Console or Chrome Enterprise, they can be wiped and reused without restriction. Unlike Windows Autopilot or JAMF for Macs (which enforce re-enrollment post-reset), these units are effectively unsecured.Due to HR policy, I can‚Äôt initiate recovery contact directly, and after 15‚Äì20 days of silence, I have to close the onboarding ticket and forward the case to HR. We've lost 11 Chromebooks in just over 2 months. Accounting is livid since they have to approve new purchases, and HR (as far as I know) hasn‚Äôt escalated or pursued recovery.So I'm stuck between weak controls, no enforcement, and growing costs.Has anyone dealt with something similar? Are there creative ways to protect Chromebook assets from this kind of loss‚Äîpolicy, tech, or workflow-wise? Open to suggestions.What would you do?submitted by/u/Silent_Justice[link][comments]</div>

In a 14 July tweet, he reiterates the 2024 blog post: the goal is better performance, faster iteration, and seamless laptop‚Äìphone integration. In this video, we unpack what that could mean for your workflow, how it might change Android laptops, and how it compares with Apple‚Äôs iOS ‚Äúwalled garden.‚Äù Do you use Android or ChromeOS today, and would this unified approach make you switch or stay?

<div id="summary-393" class="summary" style="display: none;">Does anyone else find that the finance department are always the people that think they‚Äôre entitled to their own personal printer at their desk?We have a managed print system with big copiers on key locations. But trying to get certain people to let go of their desktop printer is quite difficult.Weirdly it always seems to be finance that want to print everything off and not have to get out of their seat to collect it. Even if I explain how much HP toners cost and when the printer dies I need to buy a new one, which tends to be a different model and needs different toner.submitted by/u/AverageMuggle99[link][comments]</div>

    "summary": "Hi Guys! I'm Manu from theEterspireteam. I'm super excited to share a big milestone that we've achieved in big part thanks to this sub's support: we've officially surpassed 200.000 registered players!When I made apost about hitting 100,000 accountsat the beginning of the year, I didn't, even in my wildest dreams, think that we would double that in less than six months. For a small team like ours, this feels like a huge achievement, and with our Steam and macOS releases just around the corner (September 15th), we hope to keep this growth streak going!I know there's a lot of discussion in this sub about what makes a game grow and get popular, so I thought this could be a good chance to share a bit of insight into what helped us get to 200k, and what didn't really:What helped:Regular updates:We've been releasingtwo updates a monthsince June 2024. Back then, our team was only five people, and the crunches and deadlines were honestly a bit crazy at the beginning, but once we got into a rhythm, we really understood the importance of a regular update schedule.We know there are several different models for updates in MMOs. Some games release big, all-encompassing updates as seasons or expansions, while others release small bugfix and balance patches with more regularity. In our case, we found that giving players new content and features to discover twice a month gave them a great excuse to hop back into the game, without resorting to the usual FOMO stuff like dailies/weeklies.Eterspire has updates around the 14th and 28th of each month.Before we adopted this schedule, players didn't really know what to expect from our updates, nor when to expect them. Once we had a regular schedule, we started seeing a gradual but very consistent increase in both new and returning players, since knowing there is always new content coming to the game in a couple of weeks is always a big draw.Community building and word of mouth:One of the big draws in Eterspire is the community. This isn't just my assumption; we've had hundreds of players tell us, through reviews and comments, how they got hooked because of the friendly players that helped them get started or because of a community event they found fun. Tons of players have told us how they started playing because of their friend group, or because their partner asked them to play with them.As our community grew bigger and we put more effort into nurturing and taking care of it, we understood one key principle: most of the time your players are better at selling your game than you are.Our community members usually do a better job at conveying the strengths of the game than we ever could!You can spend hours and hours thinking of the best way to convey your game, of the perfect gameplay video, or the most effective tagline. But all that can't hold a candle to a player genuinely recommending the game to their friend because they think it's fun. In the end, if you take care of your community, the community will take care of the game.Measuring and understanding what you measure:Getting players to download your game is only one part of the equation. Once they've downloaded it, there are several steps they must go through before they can be considered an active player. This is why it's so important to track and measure these steps and understand what you can do to make the process as seamless as possible.To give you an example, for a long time, we didn't pay much attention to our account creation process, as we thought it worked fine. After taking the time to measure and analyze this step, we found out that only about 60% of the users downloading our game were actually creating an account. We were quite baffled by this. We had never considered that we could be losing 40% of our users in such a simple part of the onboarding process.Something as simple as streamlining our first login menu improved our account creation rate by almost 50%!Knowing this, we focused on making the first couple of screens and options the player sees as simple and intuitive as possible, and wouldn't you know it, that percentage jumped from 60% to over 90%. Imagine the number of users that never would've gotten to see the actual game if we had never bothered to measure or look into that process!Learning to prioritize:One of the most difficult things when developing an MMORPG, especially as a small team, is deciding what features to develop and how to manage your time. There's a whole balancing act between what you personally want to see in the game, what the community is asking for, and what you think is going to keep the game growing.Initially, this was extremely hard for us. You only have so many hours in a day, and when you're a team of 3, 4, or 5, spending a day working on a feature that players won't end up using much, or that won't bring new players in, can be demoralizing.Things got a lot better once we understood that before we begin work on any content or feature, we need a clear idea of what it accomplishes, what players will get out of it, and how it meshes with the rest of the game's progression. It's not enough that something sounds fun or it's been requested by some players; it has to have a clear objective that makes it worth the time we will spend developing it.Over time, this meant that players had more interesting and useful things to do in-game, and we had more time to work on the stuff that really matters, which, as our team grew, allowed us to work on bigger and bigger features!What didn't really helpAdsWhile online ads are usually a big part of player acquisition for most MMORPGs, we've had mixed results with them. Initially, we didn't have a budget to run them, and when we could finally afford to do so, they didn't really work like we expected them to.Our ads did bring in a lot of players, especially compared to the numbers we had previously, but we found that the players that came from ads weren't really staying for long or engaging with the community. We even did polls and surveys to find out how our most engaged players found out about Eterspire, and ads were one of the least picked answers!We were even more surprised when, after several months of running ad campaigns, we did a test to see what would happen if we turned them off. We did have some weeks with lower numbers, but after that, our new players per day began steadily growing, and these players were staying. Store algorithms began showing us to players that vibed a lot better with our game, we started showing up much higher in search results, and word of mouth improved a lot!It seemed like while ads brought a lot of raw numbers, the number of actual engaged players that came from them was comparatively small. Our big takeaway here is that Eterspire is a game that does much better organically and through recommendations than with big ad campaigns and calls to action.----Well, that's all I have to share today. I hope this post sheds a bit of light on what developing an MMORPG is like! If you guys have any questions about the game or our development process, I'd be happy to answer you in the comments :)submitted by/u/Reasonable_Wish_6022[link][comments]",

No one else can do his job so here I am with this shit.6 years ago we hired a new CTO who blew millions of dollars on a rebuild of the entire application in Azure. It failed spectacularly, never worked at all, and now the whole company is scrambling to make sales and polish up this old turd of an application that runs on old SQL code and has our internal users still interacting with it on Access 97.submitted by/u/shmehh123[link][comments]",

    "summary": "A few months ago, I shared on this sub how I made my first game ever, an iOS-only idle clicker game calledCookie Empire: Idle Clicker.It's obviously inspired by the famous Cookie Clicker, which is unfortunately not available for iOS just yet. There are many other idle clickers out there, so I\u2019m trying hard to avoid the usual traps: forced ads, pay-to-win balance, confusing UI, and shallow mechanics. I'm doing an honest effort to make a good game. A game that's fun, fair and still profitable. I bounce most ideas withthis amazing Discord community, in which we discuss balancing, bugs, new features, and roadmap. We're nearly at 1000 members!So far, I'm proud of the game including these features: - No game-interrupting ads - Offline play - More than 50+ unique buildings- Gardening minigame - Stock market simulator minigame - Lucky Wheel minigame - Ascension mechanics - A \"sacrifice grandmas and feed their souls to japanese demons while you keep falling to the depths of hell\" mechanic - Coins are the reward from minigames, which can be exchanged for Cookies - 3 Public leaderboards with different objectivesRecent updates to the game, most of them coming from the Discord community: - Different types of Magic Cookies - More \"Revelations\" with synergistic effects - New Cookie skins - Swipe-to-harvest for the Garden minigame.Flaws I'm actively working on: - Performance isn't great. When you're in the late game and have a gazillion buildings, power-ups, magic cookies and things going on, the phone's battery gets drained pretty fast. I need to get better at this - Collecting offline idle production requires watching one ad (or buying one IAP that unlocks it forever). This is the main driver of revenue, but also the most controversial bit of the game. I know now the expectation in these games is for offline production to be free and having an opt-in ad to double/triple it. I'm testing out how to change and fix this.This keeps being a work in progress, as always. I'm pushing new updates almost every week and spending every bit of free time I've got into making this game better. Your feedback is extremely useful and really helps me out. Sometimes it stings, but I really use it to get better as a developer and make the game better.submitted by/u/mrknoot[link][comments]",

That said, the content below is identical to what I originally posted, aside from this introductory paragraph. I\u2019ll try cross-posting to the Apple Arcade subreddit again and hope the moderators will approve it this time.I really hoped Apple would follow its \u201cThink Different\u201d philosophy, one that has inspired creatives and curious minds for decades, and shaped its product design strategy.But today, the reality is disappointing: we have a dedicated casino games category and ads all over the App Store. The service they pitched as a paradigm shift for gaming on Apple platforms has turned into a dumping ground for hyper-casual, low-complexity, addiction-driven games. It feels completely at odds with the values that made Apple a truly special company.submitted by/u/SquirrelBlue135[link][comments]",

Built by superyacht captain Johny, this stunning rainforest tiny house is a personal paradise, designed as the ultimate retreat from the world. When he's not sailing the globe with the rich and famous, Johny returns to this peaceful sanctuary to surf, recharge, and reconnect with nature.\n\nThe home itself is a masterclass in tiny house design. With a single-level layout and a focus on openness and flow, it makes the most of its lush surroundings. Massive picture windows bring the forest inside, creating a seamless connection to the outdoors. The home feels expansive, calm, and deeply rooted in its environment.\n\nOutside, the landscaping is equally as impressive. A generous deck expands the living area into the forest, while natural elements like boulders and large timber logs have been thoughtfully placed to ground the home in the landscape. It\u2019s the perfect blend of modern design and raw, untamed nature.\n\nThis is a tiny home that you won't want to miss. We absolutely loved getting to visit this rainforest retreat and share Johny\u2019s incredible story with you. We hope you enjoy the tour as much as we did.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f If you enjoy our show and would like to help support our work, please consider supporting us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/livingbig\n\n\ud83c\udf1f Our Socials and Links: https://linktr.ee/livingbig\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Find out more about this tiny house and others on our website: https://www.livingbiginatinyhouse.com/\n\nPlease subscribe for more videos on tiny houses, architecture, DIY, design, and sustainable, off-grid living.\n\nPresented and Produced by: Bryce Langston\nCamera: Rasa Pescud & Bryce Langston\nEditing:  Sarah Binder & Rasa Pescud\n\nAdditional video supplied by Johny\n\nTitle music in this video by Bryce Langston: http://www.youtube.com/brycelangston\n\n'Living Big in a Tiny House' \u00a9 2025 Zyia Pictures Ltd\n\n#tinyhouse #tinyhousetour #rainforest #tinyhouseparadise #tinyhome #innature  #homedesign",

    "summary": "So this is happening. Our \"trusted\" integration partner just went radio silent three weeks before go-live, their project manager isn't returning calls, and I'm pretty sure they've moved on to easier clients. Cool. Cool cool cool.Context: I'm the IT director at a 200-bed hospital and we've been trying to replace our patient portal that literally still uses Flash. I know, I KNOW. Don't @ me. We got funding approved last year after our patient satisfaction scores tanked because people couldn't even log in to see their test results half the time.Found this vendor who promised seamless Epic integration, showed us these beautiful demos, the whole nine yards. Signed a contract in January, paid the first milestone payment, and everything seemed legit. Their team was responsive, they knew all the right FHIR buzzwords, even had references from other health systems.Then reality hit. The API calls started timing out randomly. Patient data was syncing but missing critical fields. Their \"certified Epic integration\" turned out to be a bunch of custom middleware that broke every time Epic pushed an update. When I asked about it, suddenly their developer who \"built similar solutions for Mayo Clinic\" was always in meetings.Last month they missed two major deadlines. When I finally got their PM on the phone, he basically admitted they'd never actually integrated with our version of Epic before and were \"figuring it out as we go.\" That's when I started drinking at lunch.Three weeks ago: complete silence. Emails bouncing back. Phone goes straight to voicemail. I'm starting to think they just took our money and bailed.Meanwhile, my CEO is asking for status updates, our chief medical officer is making jokes about our \"state-of-the-art 1990s technology,\" and I've got 50 physicians who were promised a working patient portal by next month.I'm sitting here at 11 PM googling \"how to build Epic integration from scratch\"...Anyone know a good therapist who specializes in IT trauma? Asking for a friend who is definitely me....submitted by/u/Tiny_Habit5745[link][comments]",

Get your copy now.\n\nArchitect Caroline Duncan's compact apartment is bright, flexible and full of custom DIY solutions and  smart storage. Thoughtful, inventive details include a customised Muji bench that provides both window seating and hidden storage, a modular felt sofa that easily converts into a bed, and a cat-friendly laundry nook that discreetly houses a litter box. The kitchen is a seamless blend of high and low, combining IKEA carcasses with bespoke birch plywood fronts and porcelain handles inherited from family. A full-height storage wall cleverly unifies the kitchen and wardrobe space while concealing a mirrored door to the bedroom. Subtle multifunctionality is scattered through-out the home: a recessed headboard niche doubles as a projector shelf, and a wall-mounted desk preserves the openness of the living space.\n\n00:00-00:57 Introduction \n00:57-01:22 Location \n01:22-03:31 Floor Plan\n03:31-04:49 Entrance\n04:49-06:46 Living Area\n06:46-10:00 Kitchen\n10:00-11:46 Bedroom\n11:46-12:44 Bathroom\n12:44-13:39 Conclusion\n\n#smallapartment #architecture #interiordesign \n\nEp 230\nProject Name: Caroline Duncan's Apartment\nArchitect: https://www.instagram.com/caro_duncan/ \n\nProduced by New Mac Video Agency\nCreator: Colin Chee\nProducer: Lindsay Barnard\nDirector and Cinematographer: Nam Tran\nEditor: Jessica Ruasol\nMusic: Artlist.io\nSunset by Ben Hendler\nDreaming of a Song by Amos Ever Hadani\nReflection Lake by Ariel Shalom\nMoon Dance by JADE VY\n\nShare your projects with us- https://www.nevertoosmall.com/submissions\nSubscribe to our newsletter- https://www.nevertoosmall.com/subscribe \nCheck out our store- https://www.nts-store.com\nWebsite- https://www.nevertoosmall.com\nInstagram-  https://www.instagram.com/nvtsmall\nFacebook- https://www.facebook.com/nvtsmall",

Only authorized IT contacts have keys and policy forbids storage in network closets.Boss demands to have a list of everyone's passwords.Nope. Nobody can have anyone else's password by policy. Doing so would result in termination. No boss can override thisRandom desktop on a shelf in the data centerNope. Desktop computers are not allowed in the data center. Period.25 year old desktop with NT4 running the voicemail system in a closetNope. This would be a massive violation of the information security policy.Boss doesn't like MFA and forces you to turn it off for his accountNope. Information security policy requires everyone have MFA no matter who they are.A manager wants access to a former employee's email account and then starts sending email as them for months on endNope. If an employee leaves it requires multiple approvals including HR to get access to their email account, and only for long enough to copy the mail out and then it is closed down again. Old accounts can not be kept open indefinitely. Business process needs to be built around this because when people leave their accounts are absolutely deleted after a grace period.The finance lady insists she must have her own personal printer and the boss says to give it to herNope. There is no \"finance lady\" because finance is an entire department staffed by employees who have to operate as employees like everyone else and use the same equipment as everyone else. They can use secure release on the same printers as everyone else.It isn't all sunshine and roses by any means but we don't do a bunch of stupid nonsense that is just blatantly awful. There are no hubs under desks and servers in the bathroom. The microwave is not an IT responsibility. IT does not assemble furniture. We have a standard replacement cycle for our laptops every 3-4 years. Nobody has a gaming PC on their desk because they think they're special. Random non-technical executives do not have domain admin access just because they want it.We have a whole host of other issues, but at least we have none of these problems.submitted by/u/crankysysadmin[link][comments]",

No announcements, no further information. Seems like an open zero day being leveraged. We don't host an MX with microsoft's fallback domain. We don't allow relaying from outside of our network on our SMTP relay. Really stumped on this one. Microsoft said \"Submit these messages to us and we will fix it on the back end\". Seems very suspicious. The tech assisting us even possibly pretended to not know the term zero day. Almost like they were instructed to not admit to a zero day.Update: Thanks everyone for your engagement on this post. As for my case, I think I can disable Direct Send for my environment. We are not sending mail directly to microsoft, everything goes through our gateway. Someone mentioned \"connectors bypass Direct Send\" and that's all I needed to know.Update 2: We disabled Direct Send today. We just had to make sure we had our connectors to and from our gateway configured properly. So far, things are working great and any Direct Send emails are just being rejected.Update 3: We believe we have mitigated all the emails that are sent From and To the same person within our org. However, we are now noticing what seems to be some emails coming from another domain into our org using microsoft's infrastructure even though we have Direct Send disabled and all mail coming from other domains are supposed to go to the gateway.submitted by/u/jaychinut[link][comments]",

    "summary": "I'm an IT asset manager for a mid-size healthcare tech company. We recently acquired a smaller firm (about 100 remote staff) that operates on a tight budget and issues Chromebooks instead of full desktop setups. Their provisioning costs are around $700 per user (Chromebook + basic accessories), compared to our standard $2,000 setups (PC/Mac + dual monitors, dock, wireless peripherals).Here\u2019s the issue: the acquired company pays new hires in the range of $12\u2013$15/hour, and we\u2019ve had a wave of \"ghost hires\"\u2014people who accept the job, sign onboarding forms acknowledging their responsibility for the equipment, receive a new Chromebook and monitor by the end of the week\u2026 and never show up on Monday. No login, no reply to texts or automated emails, no returns. They just reset the Chromebook and keep it.Because these Chromebooks aren't enrolled in Google Admin Console or Chrome Enterprise, they can be wiped and reused without restriction. Unlike Windows Autopilot or JAMF for Macs (which enforce re-enrollment post-reset), these units are effectively unsecured.Due to HR policy, I can\u2019t initiate recovery contact directly, and after 15\u201320 days of silence, I have to close the onboarding ticket and forward the case to HR. We've lost 11 Chromebooks in just over 2 months. Accounting is livid since they have to approve new purchases, and HR (as far as I know) hasn\u2019t escalated or pursued recovery.So I'm stuck between weak controls, no enforcement, and growing costs.Has anyone dealt with something similar? Are there creative ways to protect Chromebook assets from this kind of loss\u2014policy, tech, or workflow-wise? Open to suggestions.What would you do?submitted by/u/Silent_Justice[link][comments]",
