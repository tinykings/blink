We recently acquired a smaller firm (about 100 remote staff) that operates on a tight budget and issues Chromebooks instead of full desktop setups. Their provisioning costs are around $700 per user (Chromebook + basic accessories), compared to our standard $2,000 setups (PC/Mac + dual monitors, dock, wireless peripherals).Here\u2019s the issue: the acquired company pays new hires in the range of $12\u2013$15/hour, and we\u2019ve had a wave of \"ghost hires\"\u2014people who accept the job, sign onboarding forms acknowledging their responsibility for the equipment, receive a new Chromebook and monitor by the end of the week\u2026 and never show up on Monday. No login, no reply to texts or automated emails, no returns. They just reset the Chromebook and keep it.Because these Chromebooks aren't enrolled in Google Admin Console or Chrome Enterprise, they can be wiped and reused without restriction. Unlike Windows Autopilot or JAMF for Macs (which enforce re-enrollment post-reset), these units are effectively unsecured.Due to HR policy, I can\u2019t initiate recovery contact directly, and after 15\u201320 days of silence, I have to close the onboarding ticket and forward the case to HR. We've lost 11 Chromebooks in just over 2 months. Accounting is livid since they have to approve new purchases, and HR (as far as I know) hasn\u2019t escalated or pursued recovery.So I'm stuck between weak controls, no enforcement, and growing costs.Has anyone dealt with something similar? Are there creative ways to protect Chromebook assets from this kind of loss\u2014policy, tech, or workflow-wise? Open to suggestions.What would you do?submitted by/u/Silent_Justice[link][comments]",

      "summary": "I just wanted to share my experience finally demoing the Apple Vision Pro this past weekend.I had time to kill at Memorial City Mall, one of the busiest malls, located off one of the busiest freeways (Katy Freeway) in Houston, the fourth-largest city in the U.S. While my wife and kids were back-to-school shopping, I wandered into the packed Apple Store. Everything was bustling, except for the Apple Vision Pro table, which stood out like a deserted island in a sea of dynamic islands.I've never done the demo, so I scanned the QR code to schedule one. The next slot was in 10 minutes, so I messed around with some Macs (Sneaky Sasquatch has reached dock status, FYI).Eventually, an employee checked to make sure I hadn\u2019t accidentally signed up for a class or Genius Bar appointment. A few minutes later, another employee came over, friendly but with big \u201cjust got pulled off break\u201d energy, and told me I was thefirst person in weeksto request a Vision Pro demo during his shifts.The demo itself? Mind-blowing, of course, but also neck-breaking. I\u2019ve got pre-existing neck issues, and the weight of the unit started taking a toll within minutes. But hey, the Metallica concert was cool.Here\u2019s the interesting part: while I was mid-demo, I heard two or three different people come over and ask about trying it themselves. The not-thrilled employee told them they\u2019d have to sign up via the QR code too.So it begs the question: if a Vision Pro falls in the forest and no one\u2019s there to see it, does it make a sound? Apparently not. It\u2019s fallen so far off the radar that shoppers just walk right past it, until someone\u2019s using it. Then it\u2019s like a sign spinner outside a tire shop.Maybe Apple just needs to have someone visibly using it to draw a crowd again?Either way, it\u2019s got to be at least half as heavy and half as expensive for me even to consider it.submitted by/u/neatgeek83[link][comments]",
