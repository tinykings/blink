The Presidential Fitness Test for American schoolchildren was created back in 1966, and required kids to do sit-ups, push-ups, pull-ups and the one-mile run as part of a test in school gym classes.

The program changed during the Obama administration to focus more on individual health, but President Trump says it's time to bring it back.</div>

<div id="summary-7" class="summary" style="display: none;">This is my second attempt at sharing this post so I'm first posting in it another related subreddit. My initial submission to the Apple Arcade subreddit wasn’t approved by the moderators. I reached out to them for clarification didn't receive a response, so I’m still unsure why it was declined. That said, the content below is identical to what I originally posted, aside from this introductory paragraph. I’ll try cross-posting to the Apple Arcade subreddit again and hope the moderators will approve it this time.I really hoped Apple would follow its “Think Different” philosophy, one that has inspired creatives and curious minds for decades, and shaped its product design strategy.But today, the reality is disappointing: we have a dedicated casino games category and ads all over the App Store. The service they pitched as a paradigm shift for gaming on Apple platforms has turned into a dumping ground for hyper-casual, low-complexity, addiction-driven games. It feels completely at odds with the values that made Apple a truly special company.submitted by/u/SquirrelBlue135[link][comments]</div>

オバレク感想(ネタバレなし)＆その他諸々の話🫣





↓          ↓          ↓







OVER REQUIEMZ、まだプレイ途中なのですが久しぶりにしっかり乙女ゲームを満喫できていて毎日とても充実しております🕺

全体的に糖度はあまり高くないので、恋愛要素＜ストーリー重視で鬱展開・闇堕ちにも対応できるダークファンタジー好きの乙女ゲーマーさん向け作品です🙂‍↕️
流血シーンも多数故のCERO Dだったので好みは分かれると思いますが、
「乙女ゲーやりたいけど時間ないしなぁ…」と思っている方にこそオススメしたいです！！！🤝

乙女ゲーム最大の魅力であり難点は、全キャラ攻略に膨大な時間がかかるということ。
私は細かな分岐もエンドもボイスも全回収したいと思ってしまうので、まとまった時間が取れなくなると「また今度…」と後回しにしてしまい、次第に乙女ゲーそのものから遠ざかるようになっていました。

ですが！オバレクは、乙女ゲー出戻り＆リハビリ勢にとってもやさしい仕様なんです…！！！泣

・乙女ゲー特有のミニゲームなどはなし
・共通ルートが短く、すぐにキャラ選択に入る
・各キャラのエンドは4種固定

とにかく操作がシンプルで気になるキャラがいるのに共通ルートがなかなか終わらないというジレンマに陥ることもありません。
ストーリー上で選択画面が出てきますが、結末に影響する分岐選択は数回しかなく、デザインも通常選択と差別化されていてわかりやすいのでエンド回収も苦労しません。
そうなんです、夜な夜な攻略サイトと睨めっこしながらセーブとロードを繰り返す必要がないんです。
諸々の″面倒さ″が乙女ゲームの醍醐味でもあるので物足りなさを感じてしまう方もいらっしゃるかもしれませんが、ただひたすらにドキドキハラハラなストーリー展開と美しいスチルを浴びることができるので、忙しい社会人オタクの方も気軽に楽しめると思います。

個別のキャラルートに進んでしばらくしたあとに真相(fact)ルートと闇堕(dark)ルートの分岐があって、これが本当に、すごく良い…！！
たった一つの選択の違いで、同じキャラでもここまで展開が変わってしまうのか…と震え上がります。
今までプレイしてきた乙女ゲーの傾向的にバッドエンド耐性はあると自負しているのですが、オバレクのdark√はどのキャラもしっかりと奈落の底まで闇堕ちします。
本当にね、びっくりするほど微塵も救いがありません。期待しちゃダメなんです。
ホラー要素も強めで背筋が冷える場面が何度もありました。暑い夏にもぴったりですね😉
画面はかなりの頻度で赤く染まるので、グロ系が苦手な方は厳しいかもしれません。
訳アリ死刑囚達と旅をする物語なので終始不穏な空気が漂っておりますが、fact√にはきちんと救いがあります。これが真実で良かったと、心から思える。darkとの温度差で風邪ひきます。

私は今、クロード⇨ドロシー(dark)⇨モリィの順番で攻略中です💨
キャラ攻略に制限がないので基本的に誰からプレイしても楽しめるシステムなのも嬉しいですね。
ドロシーは特に気になっていたキャラでもあったので2番目にプレイしたのですが……。
これは物語の根幹に関わりそうだなとdark√を通して感じたので、fact√だけ最後にプレイしようと温め中です😋

友人から教えてもらって知ったのですが、フローチャートの各項目がキャラ視点で描かれていて震えます。最高すぎて。
そしていつぞやから当たり前のように搭載されるようになったフローチャート機能、本当に愛してます。このおかげでセーブデータが飽和することも無くなりましたね。

オバレクプレイ前で印象に残っている乙女ゲームは、直近だと『ジャックジャンヌ』と『終遠のヴィルシュ』。
どちらも全く違う系統でありますが、「これぞ乙女ゲーム・シュミレーションゲームの真骨頂！」と思えるほどに最高の作品でした。
でもそれぞれ発売が2021年。なんともう4年も経っちゃってるんですよね。時の流れが早すぎて怖いです。終ヴィルFDの 『-EpiC:lycoris-』でも発売は約2年前…。
「今後この２タイトルのインパクトを超える新作乙女ゲームにはなかなか出会えないのでは…？」と不安になるレベルで、本当に何もかもが良かったんです。
(というよりも、こんなにも心に刺さって情緒が乱されてしまう素敵な作品が同じ年に発売されていたことの方がきっと奇跡。)
終ヴィルのFDをプレイし終わって以降、Switchの電源を入れるのは好きな過去作品のスチルをたまに眺める時くらい。
新作ゲームの情報を積極的に探しに行くこともなくなり、たまにオトメイトchのサムネをふわっと見る程度の日々が続いていました。

けれども今年の4月、オバレク発売前に偶然目にしたクロード√プレイ動画を見て思考停止。
他のキャラもしっかりとチェックして、「あ、これは刺さるやつ✋」と確信しました✋
過去作品だとBLACK WOLVES SAGAを通ってる人は結構好きなんじゃないかな？なんて思っています。懐かしいですね。私は双子が好きでした😌
乙女ゲームのキャスト声優さんの層も変わってきていて時代は流れているんだなぁとひしひし感じます。
カイゼ役の阿座上さんはラディアンテイルで初めて知り、良い声の方だなぁ〜！と思っていたのでまた攻略対象キャラとして出会えて嬉しかったです🙏カイゼ√楽しみだ〜〜

そんなこんなでオバレクのおかげで日常の中でゲームをする体力回復＆時間捻出できるようになったので、他のタイトルもプレイしていこうかな？と思います🔥
おすすめの作品があったら教えていただけると嬉しいです🕺
有名作品だと薄桜鬼やうたプリが好きです🫶
乙女ゲーやドラマCDにどっぷりハマったきっかけがディアラバなので、基本的にどれだけ突飛な設定でも受け入れ体制は整っていると思います(?)
9 R.I.Pも気になっていたので、阿座上さんもいらっしゃるし…一番気になるキャラのCVは立花さんだし…買ってみようかな…？と思っています😌
ときメモもずーっと購入を検討しています📝
昔の作品も記憶が抜けているところがたくさんあるので、このタイミングで再履修するのも面白そう。オタクってやっぱり、楽しい🙏🙏🙏

Street of Dreams is an unfinished documentary film about the musician Tiny Tim and the 1979 Ghost Train fire at Luna Park Sydney, directed and produced by Australian artist Martin Sharp. The film first features Tiny Tim, showcasing footage of his record-setting, two-hour-and-seventeen-minute professional singing marathon at Luna Park Sydney in January 1979. It tells Tiny's life story, framed around the marathon performance footage, while highlighting his many eccentricities, religious convictions and others hangups as captured by Sharp's camera crews in both Australia and the United States.</div>

<p class="feed-title">Living Big In A Tiny House</p>
<button class="toggle-summary-btn" data-target="summary-18">...</button>
<div id="summary-18" class="summary" style="display: none;">Step inside this absolutely breathtaking modern tiny home set deep in the heart of the Australian rainforest. Here amongst the towering trees, tiny house magic has been created!  Built by superyacht captain Johny, this stunning rainforest tiny house is a personal paradise, designed as the ultimate retreat from the world. When he's not sailing the globe with the rich and famous, Johny returns to this peaceful sanctuary to surf, recharge, and reconnect with nature.

The home itself is a masterclass in tiny house design. With a single-level layout and a focus on openness and flow, it makes the most of its lush surroundings. Massive picture windows bring the forest inside, creating a seamless connection to the outdoors. The home feels expansive, calm, and deeply rooted in its environment.

Outside, the landscaping is equally as impressive. A generous deck expands the living area into the forest, while natural elements like boulders and large timber logs have been thoughtfully placed to ground the home in the landscape. It’s the perfect blend of modern design and raw, untamed nature.

This is a tiny home that you won't want to miss. We absolutely loved getting to visit this rainforest retreat and share Johny’s incredible story with you. We hope you enjoy the tour as much as we did.

<div id="summary-20" class="summary" style="display: none;">Nintendo is joining the crows and raising prices on old hardware. The base Switch is now estimated to cost $299 without a bundled game, and prices are going up across the board on older models and accessories. This comes after similar moves by Xbox and PlayStation in other territories but now we can add Nintendo’s case to the list :/

<div id="summary-28" class="summary" style="display: none;">Jake Shane is a comedian and host of the hit podcast "Therapuss with Jake Shane," and Coco Jones is a Grammy-winning singer, songwriter, and actress you probably know from her work on Bel-Air. But today, these breakout stars have two choices: Tell the truth, or suffer the wrath of the Last Dab. Whoever eats the most wings, loses!

From Jake trying dishes from his "things I don't like list," to revealing embarrassing overshares, these two will either need to be honest, or go head-to-head with the Wings of Death. Can Jake rank his fellow podcast hosts from best to worst? Will Coco reveal which city she's least excited to perform for? Tune in to an all-new episode of Hot Ones Versus, and see who takes home the golden chicken wing trophy!

macOS 26 is now available in public beta, and after a month of testing, I’m ready to share my early review of macOS 26. From a complete redesign of Spotlight Search to the new Liquid Glass UI, this update feels like a big leap forward for Mac users.

✅ Liquid Glass Design – Translucent UI, customizable icons, and widgets
✅ Spotlight Search Revamped – New clipboard manager, file search, and macOS actions
✅ Control Center Overhaul – More like iOS/iPadOS, fully customizable
✅ Phone App on Mac – Make calls, screen calls, and manage voicemail
✅ Reminders with Apple Intelligence – Auto-categorize your tasks
✅ Notes Markdown Export, Messages polls & typing indicators, Photos app updates
✅ New Apps – Games app, Journal app, and more
✅ macOS 26 Stability – Surprisingly solid for a beta

Apple’s making macOS feel more intelligent, integrated, and fluid than ever before. If you’re on the fence about installing the beta, I’ll walk you through what works, what’s promising, and whether it’s stable enough for daily use.

🔔 Don’t forget to subscribe and turn on notifications for more Apple beta coverage, including iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Sequoia, and more.

<div id="summary-45" class="summary" style="display: none;">Liam Neeson joins GQ as he revisits some of the most iconic characters from his career so far: his role as Bryan Mills in the action-thriller _Taken_ to his portrayal of Qui-Gon Jinn in _Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace._

“Oh, please! Hardly a Master Jedi,” Neeson scoffs as he recalls the death of Qui-Gon Jinn during an encounter with Darth Maul in which Ewan McGregor’s Obi-Wan Kenobi helplessly watches on. Watch the full episode of GQ’s Iconic Characters as Liam Neeson breaks down his most iconic movie roles.

<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/qpDJFFlEpFg" target="_blank">Poll: Most adults plan to skip COVID shot this fall</a></h2>
<p class="published-date">2025-08-01 08:45:11</p>
<p class="feed-title">NPR</p>
<button class="toggle-summary-btn" data-target="summary-47">...</button>
<div id="summary-47" class="summary" style="display: none;">According to a new poll from the health research group KFF, most adults in the U.S. don’t plan to get another COVID-19 shot this fall, and many are confused about new federal vaccine policies.

More than 1,200 adults were surveyed in July; 59% said they do not expect to get a COVID vaccine this fall. Older adults and Democrats were most likely to say they want another shot. Most Republicans say they don’t. Many parents also said they’re confused about whether the vaccines are still recommended for children.

The Trump administration has narrowed who’s eligible for the shots — to people age 65 and older and younger people with other health problems. Federal officials recommend that parents should talk to their doctors before vaccinating their kids.</div>

<h2><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1mexxpv/our_epic_integration_vendor_just_ghosted_us/" target="_blank">Our Epic integration vendor just ghosted us mid-project and I'm having a breakdown</a></h2>

<div id="summary-57" class="summary" style="display: none;">So this is happening. Our "trusted" integration partner just went radio silent three weeks before go-live, their project manager isn't returning calls, and I'm pretty sure they've moved on to easier clients. Cool. Cool cool cool.Context: I'm the IT director at a 200-bed hospital and we've been trying to replace our patient portal that literally still uses Flash. I know, I KNOW. Don't @ me. We got funding approved last year after our patient satisfaction scores tanked because people couldn't even log in to see their test results half the time.Found this vendor who promised seamless Epic integration, showed us these beautiful demos, the whole nine yards. Signed a contract in January, paid the first milestone payment, and everything seemed legit. Their team was responsive, they knew all the right FHIR buzzwords, even had references from other health systems.Then reality hit. The API calls started timing out randomly. Patient data was syncing but missing critical fields. Their "certified Epic integration" turned out to be a bunch of custom middleware that broke every time Epic pushed an update. When I asked about it, suddenly their developer who "built similar solutions for Mayo Clinic" was always in meetings.Last month they missed two major deadlines. When I finally got their PM on the phone, he basically admitted they'd never actually integrated with our version of Epic before and were "figuring it out as we go." That's when I started drinking at lunch.Three weeks ago: complete silence. Emails bouncing back. Phone goes straight to voicemail. I'm starting to think they just took our money and bailed.Meanwhile, my CEO is asking for status updates, our chief medical officer is making jokes about our "state-of-the-art 1990s technology," and I've got 50 physicians who were promised a working patient portal by next month.I'm sitting here at 11 PM googling "how to build Epic integration from scratch"...Anyone know a good therapist who specializes in IT trauma? Asking for a friend who is definitely me....submitted by/u/Tiny_Habit5745[link][comments]</div>

After this time, applications and devices will no longer be able to use Basic auth as an authentication method and must use OAuth when using SMTP AUTH to send email....The only remediation for this is to update your client or app to support OAuth, use a different client or app that supports OAuth, or use a different email solution such as High Volume Email or Azure Communication Services for Email.Primarily concerned about scan to email, as well as some various apps set up to do email reporting on my end.submitted by/u/01101110011O1111[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-65" class="summary" style="display: none;">The UK’s Online Safety Act just went into effect and VPN downloads are surging. ProtonVPN soared to #1 in the App Store after a staggering 1,400% increase in UK signups. In this video, I break down what’s happening, why people are turning to VPNs to protect their identity and bypass invasive age verification checks, and why I recommend ProtonVPN over less secure alternatives.

AI is helping people with life advice, but chats with mainstream models are not legally confidential. In this video, we explain Sam Altman’s comments on ChatGPT privacy, show Proton LUMO, and compare how a zero-access, open source, European-hosted assistant treats your data. We also cover Proton VPN, cash and crypto payments, and why UK age-verification rules are driving signups. If you care about privacy, encryption, and reducing data exposure, this walkthrough is for you.

I Turned My Mac mini Into a Retro Mac — Here’s How

Transform your M4 Mac mini into a retro 1980s-style Macintosh! 🖥️ The Wokyis Retro Docking Station is a 13-in-1 USB-C hub with a built-in 5-inch display, NVMe SSD slot, and all the ports you could ever need. Starting at just $99 on Kickstarter, it’s not only functional—it’s one of the coolest desk accessories I’ve seen in 2025.

In this video, I unbox it, set it up with my Mac mini, and test out everything from the display to the SSD enclosure. Is this the ultimate retro-meets-modern Mac accessory? Let’s find out.

<div id="summary-70" class="summary" style="display: none;">I'm scanning my brain inside a plane that’s about to be hurtling toward the ground. Here's why... 

It tests the effects of zero gravity on the brain, specifically, how well you can tell if stuff is upright or not! Which is really important for doing delicate experiments in space… 

You put your head in this hole and watch a screen with this little line on it. Every time it changes, you have to hit a button to say whether you think it’s vertical or tilted. It’s surprisingly hard!

But this task is special...

Experiments like this are giving us valuable data for a future where humans are living long term in space.

If you want to see another experiment I did with a blood sucking sleeping bag… subscribe!

<div id="summary-74" class="summary" style="display: none;">You don’t need to disappear off the grid to stay private online. But you do need a strategy.

In this video, we break down how to use social media without revealing your real identity. We’ll walk through how to understand your threat model, avoid common mistakes, and build a pseudonymous identity that actually protects you.

Whether you're just trying to keep your boss out of your business or avoid serious profiling, we’ll help you match your privacy tactics to your risk level, step by step.

00:00 Anonymity Should be BANNED

06:24 Level 1 Basic Protections
08:51 Level 2 Advanced Protections

19:23 The Good News

Achieving basic pseudonymity online is much easier than it sounds, and you absolutely have the power to reclaim it. Start from wherever you are. Every step you take makes a difference.

Happy August 1st! Crazy how fast the year’s flying by. 😭

I wanted to share a few techy / desk setup–y things I do as a creator at the start of every month.

Realigning with myself (both as a solo creator and a creative) is how I stay grounded and ready for whatever’s next.

I hope this gives you ideas on how to build your own monthly rituals. Save this for later, or send it to someone who might need it. 💾⬇️

<div id="summary-86" class="summary" style="display: none;">"I combine my language with hip-hop so that, via hip-hop, my culture could continue living," says Eber Quisbert, a 40-year-old Bolivian rapper. Quisbert performs with his mentee and fellow Bolivian rapper, Carlos Orellana, 26, whose stage name is Andes Mc. The performers mix Spanish lyrics with Quechua and Aymara, two indigenous languages.

One of the songs they performed, "Jina Jina Mayma," tells the story of tensions between Bolivia's indigenous regions, blending their Quechua and Guarani languages. The title means "Let's go, everyone."

"We created a song like this because everyone just wants to live peacefully," Quisbert recalls. His lyrics aim to inspire unity and peace: "I'm from here, you're from there. Let's join hands, ready to move forward. Shout for liberty to the beat of equality. Leave behind prejudice, we are just one."</div>

<div id="summary-93" class="summary" style="display: none;">Started a job about a month ago as my second ever IT job. The first one I had was classic HellDesk, pretty much a body just to block calls, doing about as much IT support as the user themselves could do. I got a offer from a relatively small local MSP, >50 employees. This place is... different. Right now I'm working "Dispatch" essentially the first line for calls, fixing whatever I can in 40 minutes or less, and if it's harder than that, escalate to the tier 2's. The only thing is, I have access to... everything. We have about 50 companies as clients, some including hospitals with hundreds of employees, and I can access everything. I have free reign to fuck with switches, routers, firewalls, domain admin passwords, rmms to run stuff at system level if needed, all automations. Literally everything we manage for all of our clients has credentials posted inside of our documentation somewhere. Every type of server we manage for them, exchange/365 admin access, access through a couple different RMMs with automation possibilities if I need to automate stuff at the system level, literally everything from top to bottom, I have access to it, and I'm at the very bottom of our totem pole here. Is this normal? I'm learning tons of stuff every day, so it's the best to come into as a new guy, but man it feels like the wild west. Is this just how small msps are?submitted by/u/SliceOk2325[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-100" class="summary" style="display: none;">This episode features co-founders of fal, Burkay Gur and Gorkem Yurtseven.

fal is a generative media platform. They just raised their Series C round of $125M, which values them at a $1.5B valuation.

In 2020, during the COVID bubble in Palm Springs, two Turkish engineers – one from Amazon, one from Coinbase – started exploring startup ideas together. Starting with just image models when everyone said the market was too small, they stuck to their vision while competitors chased LLMs. They foresaw the video revolution coming. They obsessed over speed, becoming #1 on every benchmark.

From two Turkish immigrants to a billion-dollar AI unicorn – this is their story.

In the first season of The Buccaneers, a group of fun-loving young American girls exploded into the tightly corseted London of the 1870s … setting hearts racing and kicking off an Anglo-American culture clash. Now the Buccaneers are no longer the invaders — England is their home. In fact, they’re practically running the place. Nan is the Duchess of Tintagel, the most influential woman in the country. Conchita is Lady Brightlingsea, heroine to a wave of young American heiresses. And Jinny is on every front page, wanted for the kidnapping of her unborn child. All of the girls have been forced to grow up and now have to fight to be heard, as they wrestle with romance, lust, jealousy, births and deaths … themes consuming all women of any age, no matter what year it is. Last time we got a taste of England. This time we’re in for a veritable feast.

Written by series creator Katherine Jakeways, season two is directed by BAFTA Award winner William McGregor, DGA Award winner Rachel Leiterman, John Hardwick and Charlie Manton. Jakeways, BAFTA Award nominee Beth Willis and BAFTA Award winner Susanna White serve as executive producers. “The Buccaneers” is produced for Apple TV+ by The Forge Entertainment, a Banijay UK company.

You move the email out of the spam box, back into inbox, and it goes back to spam a few seconds later he says.That's odd, our mail rule that sets internal to internal at SCL level -1 or whatever is a thing. Run a trace, delivered normally. KQL query - delivered normally. Not junk. Not ignore conversation feature. No block list. No mailbox rules. No Outlook plugins.I finally remote in because he's not on a job site. It's going to a folder literally called "spambox"We don't have anything that does that. Ask AI because I'm so done with this shit at this point.Day 3 of trying to figure this shit out.IT WAS HIS ****ING SAMSUNG MAIL APP ON HIS PHONE.Which we don't allow people to use because it doesn't work. We tell them to use the Outlook App, which is probably renamed Copilot AI Mail Extreme Edition X .NET Copilot Edition by now.FML I need a smoke break.

<div id="summary-123" class="summary" style="display: none;">Some answers come at a cost. Invasion Season 3 premieres August 22 on Apple TV+ https://apple.co/_Invasion 

Invasion follows an alien invasion through different perspectives around the world.  In season three, those perspectives collide for the first time, as the series’ main characters are brought together to work as a team on a critical mission to infiltrate the alien mothership. The ultimate apex aliens have finally emerged, rapidly spreading their deadly tendrils across our planet. It will take all our heroes working together, using all their experience and expertise, to save our species. New relationships are formed, old relationship are challenged and even shattered, as our international cast of characters must become a team before it’s too late. 

The third season of Invasion stars returning cast members Golshifteh Farahani, Shioli Kutsuna, Shamier Anderson, India Brown, Shane Zaza, Enver Gjokaj, and introduces new series regular Erika Alexander.

Invasion is created by Kinberg and Weil, who also serve as executive producers alongside Audrey Chon, David Witz, Alik Sakharov, Dan Dietz, Katie O’Connell Marsh and Nick Nantell.

Brave just raised the privacy bar. Its latest update blocks Microsoft’s Recall
feature from screenshotting Brave windows by default. In this step-by-step guide I:
• Test Brave with EFF’s Cover Your Tracks
• Compare Brave vs Chrome, Tor, Firefox
• Show a clean Brave setup (dark mode, shields, Reader, search tweaks)
• Explain why ProtonVPN (1 400 % UK sign-up spike) is still my only VPN pick.

I built a tool that dynamically creates Infinite focus music that adapts to what's on your screen.

By combining a few locally-run Open-Source AI models (MagentaRT + InternVL3), it's trivial to have your own contextual, endless radio station.

Plus, I also go over some music model glitch token behavior; with absolutely terrifying results.

<div id="summary-140" class="summary" style="display: none;">Governments are pushing age verification laws that force you to upload a passport, driver’s-licence selfie or credit-card scan just to access platforms like Reddit, X (Twitter), BlueSky or Xbox Live. I unpack why this “safety” measure is a privacy nightmare.
We review the 59 GB Tea app breach that dumped women’s IDs, selfies and 1.1 million private messages online, plus the 15 billion credentials logged on Have I Been Pwned?. You’ll see how third-party vendors such as Persona store UK citizens’ data on US servers, creating cross-border exposure the moment a hacker breaks in.

That's why we are super excited to share this ingenious kitchen tool. The Cuisine Art Freeze Wand. It's basically meal prep but for homemade ice cream! You add the ingredients to the tubs ahead of time, great for fruit that's about to go bad or if you have an abundance of raspberries or black berries you can't pick quick enough.

<div id="summary-149" class="summary" style="display: none;">Fermented Watermelon Punch! 🍉
We bought a giant €20 watermelon and turned it into the most refreshing naturally fizzy punch using wild fermentation!

We ended up with over 5 litres of juice, and that was with leftover chunks! After straining out the fibre, we poured it into a big glass jar and added:
Organic lemonsChopped organic appleA handful of fresh mint

These help kickstart the wild fermentation — the natural yeasts on the fruit skins do all the magic. A few days later, we strained out the fruit, bottled it, and let it fizz up for another couple of days.

The result? A naturally carbonated, tangy-sweet, probiotic-rich watermelon punch!

📝 Companion blog post – The Tools I Use as a Designer: https://www.modmusings.com/blog/the-tools-i-use-as-a-designer

▬▬▬▬ Video Overview ▬▬▬▬
In this video, I'll walk you through my product design process, showcasing the key tools and apps at each stage. I'll demonstrate how I use sketching tools, Fusion 360 for 3D modeling, and Cinema 4D for rendering to create industrial-inspired designs. You'll also see how I leverage Figma for design documentation, Adobe Illustrator for packaging, and my complete setup for product photography and marketing videos.

At the end, you'll see the projects I've been working on over the past year: the Industrial Series. This includes the Encore Series 3 keyboard I designed with Mode and a new line of precision-machined pens with Inventery. Both products are an extension of my original “X-Ray Collection”, which uses translucent polycarbonate that reveals internal components, complemented by premium materials like brushed steel and copper.

Turns out:MsSense.exe: 12.7GBMsMpEng.exe: 3.3GBupdater.exe: 1.6GBTotal: roughly more than three times what the box even had.Cool cool. So how much RAM does this DC have?4GB. FOUR. On a domain controller. Running Defender for Endpoint.Just when I think "surely the pagefile saved it," I run:Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_PageFileSettingAnd there it is:MaximumSize : 0 Name : D:\pagefile.sysZERO.Zero kilobytes of coping mechanism. On D:.Which isn’t even the system volume.It's like giving someone a thimble of water and telling them to run a marathon in July.Anyway, i rebooted it out of pure spite. It came back.

<div id="summary-167" class="summary" style="display: none;">Discover Koske, a new breed of AI-built malware that hides in harmless-looking JPEGs and turns your Linux host into a silent crypto-miner. In this breakdown you’ll learn:

• The JupyterLab misconfiguration that gives attackers remote code execution
• Why polyglot file abuse beats classic steganography for sneaking in shellcode
• How its modular rootkit evades scans and persists after reboot
• Practical defences: hardening tips, hash-based scanning, and network egress rules

Trying to look rich is one of the biggest reasons people stay broke. In this video, I reveal 7 reasons why chasing luxury—cars, designer clothes, big houses—can actually destroy your financial future.

<div id="summary-174" class="summary" style="display: none;">In this week’s episode, we visit a 60 sqm apartment in Tanjong Pagar, one of Singapore’s oldest neighbourhoods known for its hawker centre and historic shophouses. Originally built in the 1970s, the apartment has been reconfigured from a two-bedroom layout into a single-bedroom home with an open-plan living area. The design blends nostalgia with a minimalist approach, using natural textures such as grey stone flooring, warm wood cabinetry and limewashed walls to bring a renewed sense of life to the old unit.

<div id="summary-188" class="summary" style="display: none;">Hot damn! Issue 4 of the Never Too Small Magazine is out now and available to purchase https://www.nts-store.com/. It's a wild ride through colour, creativity, and small-space brilliance. Get your copy now.

Architect Caroline Duncan's compact apartment is bright, flexible and full of custom DIY solutions and  smart storage. Thoughtful, inventive details include a customised Muji bench that provides both window seating and hidden storage, a modular felt sofa that easily converts into a bed, and a cat-friendly laundry nook that discreetly houses a litter box. The kitchen is a seamless blend of high and low, combining IKEA carcasses with bespoke birch plywood fronts and porcelain handles inherited from family. A full-height storage wall cleverly unifies the kitchen and wardrobe space while concealing a mirrored door to the bedroom. Subtle multifunctionality is scattered through-out the home: a recessed headboard niche doubles as a projector shelf, and a wall-mounted desk preserves the openness of the living space.

<div id="summary-189" class="summary" style="display: none;">I'm really wrestling with a directive from HR. They want to implement employee monitoring software for our hundreds of remote employees. The biggest headache is doing this without a massive backlash. I'm thinking about solutions that allow for silent, automated install. It's not only solid activity monitoring software and app and website tracking we need but also something easy to manage at scale for remote team management. Any thoughts on how to pull this off without causing a panic? Or pitfalls to avoid for workforce analytics at this scale? Thanks.submitted by/u/Expert-Economics-723[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-193" class="summary" style="display: none;">In the past there has been back and forth about this with people in smaller shops having one opinion and people in the large shops having another, and we definitely have our share of issues in the large enterprise, but I can say we do not have the following problems I see popping up here all the time.Secretary storing stuff in the network closed?Nope. Only authorized IT contacts have keys and policy forbids storage in network closets.Boss demands to have a list of everyone's passwords.Nope. Nobody can have anyone else's password by policy. Doing so would result in termination. No boss can override thisRandom desktop on a shelf in the data centerNope. Desktop computers are not allowed in the data center. Period.25 year old desktop with NT4 running the voicemail system in a closetNope. This would be a massive violation of the information security policy.Boss doesn't like MFA and forces you to turn it off for his accountNope. Information security policy requires everyone have MFA no matter who they are.A manager wants access to a former employee's email account and then starts sending email as them for months on endNope. If an employee leaves it requires multiple approvals including HR to get access to their email account, and only for long enough to copy the mail out and then it is closed down again. Old accounts can not be kept open indefinitely. Business process needs to be built around this because when people leave their accounts are absolutely deleted after a grace period.The finance lady insists she must have her own personal printer and the boss says to give it to herNope. There is no "finance lady" because finance is an entire department staffed by employees who have to operate as employees like everyone else and use the same equipment as everyone else. They can use secure release on the same printers as everyone else.It isn't all sunshine and roses by any means but we don't do a bunch of stupid nonsense that is just blatantly awful. There are no hubs under desks and servers in the bathroom. The microwave is not an IT responsibility. IT does not assemble furniture. We have a standard replacement cycle for our laptops every 3-4 years. Nobody has a gaming PC on their desk because they think they're special. Random non-technical executives do not have domain admin access just because they want it.We have a whole host of other issues, but at least we have none of these problems.submitted by/u/crankysysadmin[link][comments]</div>

“Foundation” has captivated audiences with its intricate world-building, stunning visuals, bold storytelling, and compelling performances. Season 3 continues the epic chronicle of a band of exiles on their monumental journey to save humanity and rebuild civilization amid the fall of the Galactic Empire. 

Set 152 years after the events of Season 2, the Foundation has become increasingly established far beyond its humble beginnings while the Cleonic Dynasty’s Empire has dwindled. As both of these galactic powers forge an uneasy alliance, a threat to the entire galaxy appears in the fearsome form of a warlord known as “The Mule” whose sights are set on ruling the universe by use of physical and military force, as well as mind control. It’s anyone’s guess who will win, who will lose, who will live, and who will die as Hari Seldon, Gaal Dornick, the Cleons, and Demerzel play a potentially deadly game of intergalactic chess.

🎧 About This Video
Vampire Weekend is one of the only bands in history to land three #1 albums on the Billboard 200… without ever landing a single on the Hot 100. Not even A-Punk. In a music industry driven by hits, charts and TikTok virality, how did this band build a career entirely around albums? And what does that say about the way we measure success in music today?

I’m breaking down the paradox at the heart of Vampire Weekend’s career: from Contra to Modern Vampires to Only God Was Above Us and exploring how they’ve stayed true to album-first artistry in a singles-first world.

<div id="summary-253" class="summary" style="display: none;">North Korea just siphoned 17 million dollars through U-S remote jobs.

This video shows how U-S citizen Christina Chapman stockpiled laptops so DPRK workers could masquerade as Americans, win remote IT roles, and defraud 309 U-S companies, including many Fortune 500 firms, plus two abroad. Using 68 stolen identities, the ring moved millions before Chapman received a 102-month federal sentence.

• How the laptop farm operated
• Why standard vetting failed remote teams
• Simple steps to block insider threats today

This isn’t just a synthwave playlist — it’s a feeling, a dimension, a trip into the sonic beyond.
🎹 Crafted by Frequency, these tracks hit deeper than nostalgia — they breathe life into light and loneliness.

🛸 Let the synths guide you past stardust highways, through violet skies and electric dreams.
Every beat is a heartbeat of a dying star. Every melody — a memory from a future that never happened.
🌌 Feel the cosmic melancholy, the glow of the retro-future, and the gravity of emotion.

✨ This is where time dissolves and sound takes over. Play loud. Float away. Feel everything.

<div id="summary-264" class="summary" style="display: none;">This beautifully designed mouse helped me gain some MMR 💥

The AX5 Pro from @mchose_official pulls off a unique exoskeleton-inspired design with sacrificing comfort or performance. It’s a super lightweight gaming-focused mouse, with a smooth glide and a fast polling rate. To be honest, I’m just a sucker for its unique design. But I’m certain that gamers who want to climb fast are going to appreciate its ergonomic grip, and its responsive and light nature.

This must be my current favorite gaming mouse atm.

After the break, Sam and Emanuel talk about how a new UK law about age verification is impacting peoples’ ability to see footage about current events. In the subscribers-only section, Jason explains that LeBron James is not in fact pregnant.

All these systems feed us the IPs and other information to track the users but it's passive and we would have to check individual records.Any software in the market that will help us achieve this tracking request?Thanks in advance fellow sysadminsEdit: Just want to say thank you so much fellow sysadmins, Y'all are life savers.submitted by/u/186notout[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-278" class="summary" style="display: none;">From and To are the same user (someone in our org), a spoof. Subject are all juicy phishing subjects. docx, pdf, svg attachments. Document files have QR codes that are likely going to compromise users. Just got off a call with MS support. They stated "We have been seeing this for 2 months or so". No announcements, no further information. Seems like an open zero day being leveraged. We don't host an MX with microsoft's fallback domain. We don't allow relaying from outside of our network on our SMTP relay. Really stumped on this one. Microsoft said "Submit these messages to us and we will fix it on the back end". Seems very suspicious. The tech assisting us even possibly pretended to not know the term zero day. Almost like they were instructed to not admit to a zero day.Update: Thanks everyone for your engagement on this post. As for my case, I think I can disable Direct Send for my environment. We are not sending mail directly to microsoft, everything goes through our gateway. Someone mentioned "connectors bypass Direct Send" and that's all I needed to know.Update 2: We disabled Direct Send today. We just had to make sure we had our connectors to and from our gateway configured properly. So far, things are working great and any Direct Send emails are just being rejected.Update 3: We believe we have mitigated all the emails that are sent From and To the same person within our org. However, we are now noticing what seems to be some emails coming from another domain into our org using microsoft's infrastructure even though we have Direct Send disabled and all mail coming from other domains are supposed to go to the gateway.submitted by/u/jaychinut[link][comments]</div>

“Foundation” has captivated audiences with its intricate world-building, stunning visuals, bold storytelling, and compelling performances. Season 3 continues the epic chronicle of a band of exiles on their monumental journey to save humanity and rebuild civilization amid the fall of the Galactic Empire. 

Set 152 years after the events of Season 2, the Foundation has become increasingly established far beyond its humble beginnings while the Cleonic Dynasty’s Empire has dwindled. As both of these galactic powers forge an uneasy alliance, a threat to the entire galaxy appears in the fearsome form of a warlord known as “The Mule” whose sights are set on ruling the universe by use of physical and military force, as well as mind control. It’s anyone’s guess who will win, who will lose, who will live, and who will die as Hari Seldon, Gaal Dornick, the Cleons, and Demerzel play a potentially deadly game of intergalactic chess.

On earth, gravity helps your blood naturally circulate away from your brain. But in zero G, your blood isn’t getting pulled away from your head anymore.

Astronauts say being in Zero G feels like you’re being hung slightly upside down. 

So scientists are experimenting with using negative pressure to pull your blood away from your brain. The goal is to eventually turn this bag version into a pair of pants.

Astronauts in the future could put these blood-sucking anti-gravity pants on and help their brains feel like they’re still on Earth.

<div id="summary-331" class="summary" style="display: none;">I'm an IT asset manager for a mid-size healthcare tech company. We recently acquired a smaller firm (about 100 remote staff) that operates on a tight budget and issues Chromebooks instead of full desktop setups. Their provisioning costs are around $700 per user (Chromebook + basic accessories), compared to our standard $2,000 setups (PC/Mac + dual monitors, dock, wireless peripherals).Here’s the issue: the acquired company pays new hires in the range of $12–$15/hour, and we’ve had a wave of "ghost hires"—people who accept the job, sign onboarding forms acknowledging their responsibility for the equipment, receive a new Chromebook and monitor by the end of the week… and never show up on Monday. No login, no reply to texts or automated emails, no returns. They just reset the Chromebook and keep it.Because these Chromebooks aren't enrolled in Google Admin Console or Chrome Enterprise, they can be wiped and reused without restriction. Unlike Windows Autopilot or JAMF for Macs (which enforce re-enrollment post-reset), these units are effectively unsecured.Due to HR policy, I can’t initiate recovery contact directly, and after 15–20 days of silence, I have to close the onboarding ticket and forward the case to HR. We've lost 11 Chromebooks in just over 2 months. Accounting is livid since they have to approve new purchases, and HR (as far as I know) hasn’t escalated or pursued recovery.So I'm stuck between weak controls, no enforcement, and growing costs.Has anyone dealt with something similar? Are there creative ways to protect Chromebook assets from this kind of loss—policy, tech, or workflow-wise? Open to suggestions.What would you do?submitted by/u/Silent_Justice[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-333" class="summary" style="display: none;">Google’s Sameer Samat says Android and ChromeOS are becoming a single platform, with ChromeOS built on Android’s underlying technology. In a 14 July tweet, he reiterates the 2024 blog post: the goal is better performance, faster iteration, and seamless laptop–phone integration. In this video, we unpack what that could mean for your workflow, how it might change Android laptops, and how it compares with Apple’s iOS “walled garden.” Do you use Android or ChromeOS today, and would this unified approach make you switch or stay?

<div id="summary-348" class="summary" style="display: none;">Does anyone else find that the finance department are always the people that think they’re entitled to their own personal printer at their desk?We have a managed print system with big copiers on key locations. But trying to get certain people to let go of their desktop printer is quite difficult.Weirdly it always seems to be finance that want to print everything off and not have to get out of their seat to collect it. Even if I explain how much HP toners cost and when the printer dies I need to buy a new one, which tends to be a different model and needs different toner.submitted by/u/AverageMuggle99[link][comments]</div>

Jordan Bloemen and Scott Francis Winder delve into the shadowy world of digital ad fraud, uncovering how cybercriminals exploit the vast programmatic advertising ecosystem. They explore the intricate mechanisms behind ad fraud operations, highlighting the significant financial impact on legitimate businesses and the broader internet economy. As digital advertising continues to generate nearly a trillion dollars annually, understanding these fraudulent schemes is more crucial than ever.

Jordan and Scott take listeners through the rise and fall of Alexander Zhukov, infamously known as the "King of Fraud," who orchestrated the Methbot ad fraud network. By simulating human interactions with ads on fabricated websites, Zhukov tricked major brands into paying millions for non-existent ad impressions. The hosts explain how such operations not only defraud advertisers but also serve as sophisticated vehicles for money laundering, turning illicit funds into seemingly legitimate revenue streams.

The discussion further examines the technical aspects of ad fraud, including spoofing legitimate websites and manipulating real-time bidding auctions to generate fake ad traffic. Jordan and Scott highlight the challenges faced by cybersecurity experts in combating these ever-evolving threats, emphasizing the continuous cat-and-mouse game between fraudsters and those working to secure the digital advertising landscape. They also shed light on recent takedowns like the Vast Flux campaign, showcasing the ongoing efforts to dismantle large-scale fraud networks.

Building intrigue around the complexities of ad fraud, this episode offers valuable insights for both cybersecurity enthusiasts and digital marketers. By revealing the hidden layers of the ad tech ecosystem and the relentless pursuit to eliminate fraud, Jordan Bloemen and Scott Francis Winder create a compelling narrative that underscores the importance of vigilance and innovation in protecting t

he integrity of online advertising. Tune in to understand the high-stakes battle against ad fraud and its implications for the future of digital media.</div>

<div id="summary-360" class="summary" style="display: none;">I just wanted to share my experience finally demoing the Apple Vision Pro this past weekend.I had time to kill at Memorial City Mall, one of the busiest malls, located off one of the busiest freeways (Katy Freeway) in Houston, the fourth-largest city in the U.S. While my wife and kids were back-to-school shopping, I wandered into the packed Apple Store. Everything was bustling, except for the Apple Vision Pro table, which stood out like a deserted island in a sea of dynamic islands.I've never done the demo, so I scanned the QR code to schedule one. The next slot was in 10 minutes, so I messed around with some Macs (Sneaky Sasquatch has reached dock status, FYI).Eventually, an employee checked to make sure I hadn’t accidentally signed up for a class or Genius Bar appointment. A few minutes later, another employee came over, friendly but with big “just got pulled off break” energy, and told me I was thefirst person in weeksto request a Vision Pro demo during his shifts.The demo itself? Mind-blowing, of course, but also neck-breaking. I’ve got pre-existing neck issues, and the weight of the unit started taking a toll within minutes. But hey, the Metallica concert was cool.Here’s the interesting part: while I was mid-demo, I heard two or three different people come over and ask about trying it themselves. The not-thrilled employee told them they’d have to sign up via the QR code too.So it begs the question: if a Vision Pro falls in the forest and no one’s there to see it, does it make a sound? Apparently not. It’s fallen so far off the radar that shoppers just walk right past it, until someone’s using it. Then it’s like a sign spinner outside a tire shop.Maybe Apple just needs to have someone visibly using it to draw a crowd again?Either way, it’s got to be at least half as heavy and half as expensive for me even to consider it.submitted by/u/neatgeek83[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-380" class="summary" style="display: none;">There’s a huge new volcanic eruption happening right now in Iceland.

This area had been dormant for nearly 800 years - until 2021. But since then it’s had over a dozen eruptions, including 9 since 2023. Why??

Turns out it’s two things...

<div id="summary-381" class="summary" style="display: none;">So been in my current role for 18 months, technically a 3rd line sysadmin - but doing everything from 1st to 3rd - only 10% of my time is as a 3rd liner.Found another role, and handed my notice in, still have 2/3 of my notice to work out (UK - so we generally have long notice periods).New employer called me up - general catch up and chit chat. Then he drops the bombshell - your company gave a normal (yes he worked here) type reference, but your boss gave a separate negative one. Shell-shocked to be honest. Anyway he goes on to say he is not worried and I still have a job to go to.Whilst I am sorting this out with my HR director - did get me thinking. What "cunning stunt" would you leave lying around as a farewell gift for him well after you leave?Edit:Thanks for all the replies - amazing response 😊HR director has been amazing. She is going to handle this in a discreet and has offered to speak to my new employer if needs must.Was never planning to anything nasty, just annoying - so might invest in some annoy-a-tron to dot around the office and server room 😝 Thank you allsubmitted by/u/BigPete_2025[link][comments]</div>

We also go deep on buggies (yes, again), improvements to AI and combat, and the studio’s philosophy around retaining talent and preserving games.

Today I'll show you how I used Bubble to build and publish a real, working mobile app. It's a version of the Sam, the Prompt Creator GPT I made a while back that got really popular, and I wanted it to be available to more people, so I used Bubble to take it from a limited custom GPT to a fully functional, published app. To be clear I just built this app to trst the process and do not plan to maintain the application.

<div id="summary-395" class="summary" style="display: none;">Curious to hear how others are experiencing the IT job market right now. I’ve been seeing a lot of conversations about the field becoming oversaturated especially with more people entering tech chasing high salaries or remote work flexibility.Are you seeing more competition for roles? Has the demand for sysadmins and IT pros actually slowed down? Or is it just shifting toward cloud, DevOps, and automation-heavy roles?Honestly I’d love to hear your insights whether you’re hiring, job hunting, or just observing trends from within.submitted by/u/Thatmangifted[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-407" class="summary" style="display: none;">What comes after the human?

We’re living through multiple crises — ecological, technological, political. But beneath all of that is something even deeper: a crisis of the self. Who are we, really? How did we come to see ourselves as separate from the world, from each other, from the systems that sustain us? And what if that way of thinking is what got us into this mess?

Today’s guest is Mark C. Taylor, philosopher, cultural critic, and author of After the Human. Mark and Sean discuss the philosophical roots of climate change, the dangers of individualism, the false promise of techno-utopianism, and what it might mean to shift from seeing ourselves as isolated egos to members of a vast, interdependent web. They talk about AI, death, Hegel, Descartes, hope, and why ideas matter.

<div id="summary-410" class="summary" style="display: none;">What do 7-Zip and the Crowdstrike incident have in common? A ticking time bomb.

In this video, we break down the critical vulnerability affecting all 7-Zip versions before 25—and why it’s still haunting systems everywhere. From desk machines to build servers, outdated 7-Zip installs are quietly leaving environments wide open.

And here’s the kicker: 7-Zip doesn’t auto-update. No prompts. No warnings. Just silent exposure.

We also connect the dots to the Crowdstrike debacle, exposing the larger issue behind it all—the broken state of third-party patch management. Learn how to fix the disconnect, close the vulnerability gap, and finally take control of your app security.

<div id="summary-411" class="summary" style="display: none;">Open. Crash. Repeat.

A specially crafted 7-Zip archive file has the power to crash your entire system instantly—no code execution, no tricks, just… BOOM. One click. Game over.

This isn’t just a theoretical issue. If exploited at scale, this vulnerability could disrupt thousands of systems across enterprise environments in seconds.

In this video, we explain how this 7-Zip archive exploit works, why it’s so dangerous, and what makes it so terrifyingly simple. We also show what IT teams need to do right now to protect systems before the next headline hits.

Don’t sleep on this. It’s not just another CVE—it’s a shutdown button in a zip file.

That said, the content below is identical to what I originally posted, aside from this introductory paragraph. I\u2019ll try cross-posting to the Apple Arcade subreddit again and hope the moderators will approve it this time.I really hoped Apple would follow its \u201cThink Different\u201d philosophy, one that has inspired creatives and curious minds for decades, and shaped its product design strategy.But today, the reality is disappointing: we have a dedicated casino games category and ads all over the App Store. The service they pitched as a paradigm shift for gaming on Apple platforms has turned into a dumping ground for hyper-casual, low-complexity, addiction-driven games. It feels completely at odds with the values that made Apple a truly special company.submitted by/u/SquirrelBlue135[link][comments]",

Built by superyacht captain Johny, this stunning rainforest tiny house is a personal paradise, designed as the ultimate retreat from the world. When he's not sailing the globe with the rich and famous, Johny returns to this peaceful sanctuary to surf, recharge, and reconnect with nature.\n\nThe home itself is a masterclass in tiny house design. With a single-level layout and a focus on openness and flow, it makes the most of its lush surroundings. Massive picture windows bring the forest inside, creating a seamless connection to the outdoors. The home feels expansive, calm, and deeply rooted in its environment.\n\nOutside, the landscaping is equally as impressive. A generous deck expands the living area into the forest, while natural elements like boulders and large timber logs have been thoughtfully placed to ground the home in the landscape. It\u2019s the perfect blend of modern design and raw, untamed nature.\n\nThis is a tiny home that you won't want to miss. We absolutely loved getting to visit this rainforest retreat and share Johny\u2019s incredible story with you. We hope you enjoy the tour as much as we did.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f If you enjoy our show and would like to help support our work, please consider supporting us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/livingbig\n\n\ud83c\udf1f Our Socials and Links: https://linktr.ee/livingbig\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Find out more about this tiny house and others on our website: https://www.livingbiginatinyhouse.com/\n\nPlease subscribe for more videos on tiny houses, architecture, DIY, design, and sustainable, off-grid living.\n\nPresented and Produced by: Bryce Langston\nCamera: Rasa Pescud & Bryce Langston\nEditing:  Sarah Binder & Rasa Pescud\n\nAdditional video supplied by Johny\n\nTitle music in this video by Bryce Langston: http://www.youtube.com/brycelangston\n\n'Living Big in a Tiny House' \u00a9 2025 Zyia Pictures Ltd\n\n#tinyhouse #tinyhousetour #rainforest #tinyhouseparadise #tinyhome #innature  #homedesign",

    "summary": "So this is happening. Our \"trusted\" integration partner just went radio silent three weeks before go-live, their project manager isn't returning calls, and I'm pretty sure they've moved on to easier clients. Cool. Cool cool cool.Context: I'm the IT director at a 200-bed hospital and we've been trying to replace our patient portal that literally still uses Flash. I know, I KNOW. Don't @ me. We got funding approved last year after our patient satisfaction scores tanked because people couldn't even log in to see their test results half the time.Found this vendor who promised seamless Epic integration, showed us these beautiful demos, the whole nine yards. Signed a contract in January, paid the first milestone payment, and everything seemed legit. Their team was responsive, they knew all the right FHIR buzzwords, even had references from other health systems.Then reality hit. The API calls started timing out randomly. Patient data was syncing but missing critical fields. Their \"certified Epic integration\" turned out to be a bunch of custom middleware that broke every time Epic pushed an update. When I asked about it, suddenly their developer who \"built similar solutions for Mayo Clinic\" was always in meetings.Last month they missed two major deadlines. When I finally got their PM on the phone, he basically admitted they'd never actually integrated with our version of Epic before and were \"figuring it out as we go.\" That's when I started drinking at lunch.Three weeks ago: complete silence. Emails bouncing back. Phone goes straight to voicemail. I'm starting to think they just took our money and bailed.Meanwhile, my CEO is asking for status updates, our chief medical officer is making jokes about our \"state-of-the-art 1990s technology,\" and I've got 50 physicians who were promised a working patient portal by next month.I'm sitting here at 11 PM googling \"how to build Epic integration from scratch\"...Anyone know a good therapist who specializes in IT trauma? Asking for a friend who is definitely me....submitted by/u/Tiny_Habit5745[link][comments]",

Right now I'm working \"Dispatch\" essentially the first line for calls, fixing whatever I can in 40 minutes or less, and if it's harder than that, escalate to the tier 2's. The only thing is, I have access to... everything. We have about 50 companies as clients, some including hospitals with hundreds of employees, and I can access everything. I have free reign to fuck with switches, routers, firewalls, domain admin passwords, rmms to run stuff at system level if needed, all automations. Literally everything we manage for all of our clients has credentials posted inside of our documentation somewhere. Every type of server we manage for them, exchange/365 admin access, access through a couple different RMMs with automation possibilities if I need to automate stuff at the system level, literally everything from top to bottom, I have access to it, and I'm at the very bottom of our totem pole here.

Get your copy now.\n\nArchitect Caroline Duncan's compact apartment is bright, flexible and full of custom DIY solutions and  smart storage. Thoughtful, inventive details include a customised Muji bench that provides both window seating and hidden storage, a modular felt sofa that easily converts into a bed, and a cat-friendly laundry nook that discreetly houses a litter box. The kitchen is a seamless blend of high and low, combining IKEA carcasses with bespoke birch plywood fronts and porcelain handles inherited from family. A full-height storage wall cleverly unifies the kitchen and wardrobe space while concealing a mirrored door to the bedroom. Subtle multifunctionality is scattered through-out the home: a recessed headboard niche doubles as a projector shelf, and a wall-mounted desk preserves the openness of the living space.\n\n00:00-00:57 Introduction \n00:57-01:22 Location \n01:22-03:31 Floor Plan\n03:31-04:49 Entrance\n04:49-06:46 Living Area\n06:46-10:00 Kitchen\n10:00-11:46 Bedroom\n11:46-12:44 Bathroom\n12:44-13:39 Conclusion\n\n#smallapartment #architecture #interiordesign \n\nEp 230\nProject Name: Caroline Duncan's Apartment\nArchitect: https://www.instagram.com/caro_duncan/ \n\nProduced by New Mac Video Agency\nCreator: Colin Chee\nProducer: Lindsay Barnard\nDirector and Cinematographer: Nam Tran\nEditor: Jessica Ruasol\nMusic: Artlist.io\nSunset by Ben Hendler\nDreaming of a Song by Amos Ever Hadani\nReflection Lake by Ariel Shalom\nMoon Dance by JADE VY\n\nShare your projects with us- https://www.nevertoosmall.com/submissions\nSubscribe to our newsletter- https://www.nevertoosmall.com/subscribe \nCheck out our store- https://www.nts-store.com\nWebsite- https://www.nevertoosmall.com\nInstagram-  https://www.instagram.com/nvtsmall\nFacebook- https://www.facebook.com/nvtsmall",

Only authorized IT contacts have keys and policy forbids storage in network closets.Boss demands to have a list of everyone's passwords.Nope. Nobody can have anyone else's password by policy. Doing so would result in termination. No boss can override thisRandom desktop on a shelf in the data centerNope. Desktop computers are not allowed in the data center. Period.25 year old desktop with NT4 running the voicemail system in a closetNope. This would be a massive violation of the information security policy.Boss doesn't like MFA and forces you to turn it off for his accountNope. Information security policy requires everyone have MFA no matter who they are.A manager wants access to a former employee's email account and then starts sending email as them for months on endNope. If an employee leaves it requires multiple approvals including HR to get access to their email account, and only for long enough to copy the mail out and then it is closed down again. Old accounts can not be kept open indefinitely. Business process needs to be built around this because when people leave their accounts are absolutely deleted after a grace period.The finance lady insists she must have her own personal printer and the boss says to give it to herNope. There is no \"finance lady\" because finance is an entire department staffed by employees who have to operate as employees like everyone else and use the same equipment as everyone else. They can use secure release on the same printers as everyone else.It isn't all sunshine and roses by any means but we don't do a bunch of stupid nonsense that is just blatantly awful. There are no hubs under desks and servers in the bathroom. The microwave is not an IT responsibility. IT does not assemble furniture. We have a standard replacement cycle for our laptops every 3-4 years. Nobody has a gaming PC on their desk because they think they're special. Random non-technical executives do not have domain admin access just because they want it.We have a whole host of other issues, but at least we have none of these problems.submitted by/u/crankysysadmin[link][comments]",

No announcements, no further information. Seems like an open zero day being leveraged. We don't host an MX with microsoft's fallback domain. We don't allow relaying from outside of our network on our SMTP relay. Really stumped on this one. Microsoft said \"Submit these messages to us and we will fix it on the back end\". Seems very suspicious. The tech assisting us even possibly pretended to not know the term zero day. Almost like they were instructed to not admit to a zero day.Update: Thanks everyone for your engagement on this post. As for my case, I think I can disable Direct Send for my environment. We are not sending mail directly to microsoft, everything goes through our gateway. Someone mentioned \"connectors bypass Direct Send\" and that's all I needed to know.Update 2: We disabled Direct Send today. We just had to make sure we had our connectors to and from our gateway configured properly. So far, things are working great and any Direct Send emails are just being rejected.Update 3: We believe we have mitigated all the emails that are sent From and To the same person within our org. However, we are now noticing what seems to be some emails coming from another domain into our org using microsoft's infrastructure even though we have Direct Send disabled and all mail coming from other domains are supposed to go to the gateway.submitted by/u/jaychinut[link][comments]",

    "summary": "I'm an IT asset manager for a mid-size healthcare tech company. We recently acquired a smaller firm (about 100 remote staff) that operates on a tight budget and issues Chromebooks instead of full desktop setups. Their provisioning costs are around $700 per user (Chromebook + basic accessories), compared to our standard $2,000 setups (PC/Mac + dual monitors, dock, wireless peripherals).Here\u2019s the issue: the acquired company pays new hires in the range of $12\u2013$15/hour, and we\u2019ve had a wave of \"ghost hires\"\u2014people who accept the job, sign onboarding forms acknowledging their responsibility for the equipment, receive a new Chromebook and monitor by the end of the week\u2026 and never show up on Monday. No login, no reply to texts or automated emails, no returns. They just reset the Chromebook and keep it.Because these Chromebooks aren't enrolled in Google Admin Console or Chrome Enterprise, they can be wiped and reused without restriction. Unlike Windows Autopilot or JAMF for Macs (which enforce re-enrollment post-reset), these units are effectively unsecured.Due to HR policy, I can\u2019t initiate recovery contact directly, and after 15\u201320 days of silence, I have to close the onboarding ticket and forward the case to HR. We've lost 11 Chromebooks in just over 2 months. Accounting is livid since they have to approve new purchases, and HR (as far as I know) hasn\u2019t escalated or pursued recovery.So I'm stuck between weak controls, no enforcement, and growing costs.Has anyone dealt with something similar? Are there creative ways to protect Chromebook assets from this kind of loss\u2014policy, tech, or workflow-wise? Open to suggestions.What would you do?submitted by/u/Silent_Justice[link][comments]",

They explore the intricate mechanisms behind ad fraud operations, highlighting the significant financial impact on legitimate businesses and the broader internet economy. As digital advertising continues to generate nearly a trillion dollars annually, understanding these fraudulent schemes is more crucial than ever.\n\nJordan and Scott take listeners through the rise and fall of Alexander Zhukov, infamously known as the \"King of Fraud,\" who orchestrated the Methbot ad fraud network. By simulating human interactions with ads on fabricated websites, Zhukov tricked major brands into paying millions for non-existent ad impressions. The hosts explain how such operations not only defraud advertisers but also serve as sophisticated vehicles for money laundering, turning illicit funds into seemingly legitimate revenue streams.\n\nThe discussion further examines the technical aspects of ad fraud, including spoofing legitimate websites and manipulating real-time bidding auctions to generate fake ad traffic. Jordan and Scott highlight the challenges faced by cybersecurity experts in combating these ever-evolving threats, emphasizing the continuous cat-and-mouse game between fraudsters and those working to secure the digital advertising landscape. They also shed light on recent takedowns like the Vast Flux campaign, showcasing the ongoing efforts to dismantle large-scale fraud networks.\n\nBuilding intrigue around the complexities of ad fraud, this episode offers valuable insights for both cybersecurity enthusiasts and digital marketers. By revealing the hidden layers of the ad tech ecosystem and the relentless pursuit to eliminate fraud, Jordan Bloemen and Scott Francis Winder create a compelling narrative that underscores the importance of vigilance and innovation in protecting t\n\nhe integrity of online advertising.

    "summary": "I just wanted to share my experience finally demoing the Apple Vision Pro this past weekend.I had time to kill at Memorial City Mall, one of the busiest malls, located off one of the busiest freeways (Katy Freeway) in Houston, the fourth-largest city in the U.S. While my wife and kids were back-to-school shopping, I wandered into the packed Apple Store. Everything was bustling, except for the Apple Vision Pro table, which stood out like a deserted island in a sea of dynamic islands.I've never done the demo, so I scanned the QR code to schedule one. The next slot was in 10 minutes, so I messed around with some Macs (Sneaky Sasquatch has reached dock status, FYI).Eventually, an employee checked to make sure I hadn\u2019t accidentally signed up for a class or Genius Bar appointment. A few minutes later, another employee came over, friendly but with big \u201cjust got pulled off break\u201d energy, and told me I was thefirst person in weeksto request a Vision Pro demo during his shifts.The demo itself? Mind-blowing, of course, but also neck-breaking. I\u2019ve got pre-existing neck issues, and the weight of the unit started taking a toll within minutes. But hey, the Metallica concert was cool.Here\u2019s the interesting part: while I was mid-demo, I heard two or three different people come over and ask about trying it themselves. The not-thrilled employee told them they\u2019d have to sign up via the QR code too.So it begs the question: if a Vision Pro falls in the forest and no one\u2019s there to see it, does it make a sound? Apparently not. It\u2019s fallen so far off the radar that shoppers just walk right past it, until someone\u2019s using it. Then it\u2019s like a sign spinner outside a tire shop.Maybe Apple just needs to have someone visibly using it to draw a crowd again?Either way, it\u2019s got to be at least half as heavy and half as expensive for me even to consider it.submitted by/u/neatgeek83[link][comments]",

But beneath all of that is something even deeper: a crisis of the self. Who are we, really? How did we come to see ourselves as separate from the world, from each other, from the systems that sustain us? And what if that way of thinking is what got us into this mess?\n\nToday\u2019s guest is Mark C. Taylor, philosopher, cultural critic, and author of After the Human. Mark and Sean discuss the philosophical roots of climate change, the dangers of individualism, the false promise of techno-utopianism, and what it might mean to shift from seeing ourselves as isolated egos to members of a vast, interdependent web. They talk about AI, death, Hegel, Descartes, hope, and why ideas matter.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.
