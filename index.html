The airdrops land haphazardly, sometimes in the sea and sometimes the food is spoiled or unfit for human consumption.

<div id="summary-16" class="summary" style="display: none;">When it comes to EDC backpacks, function can often reign supreme. However, our aesthetic sensibilities will undoubtedly play a big role in our purchasing decision. Tactical bags are great, but if you‚Äôre like us, you‚Äôre also suckers for bags with minimal-to-no branding, few external pockets, and overall clean designs. Shining a light on this ‚Äúless-is-more‚Äù mentality, we‚Äôve gotten hands-on with the best men‚Äôs minimalist backpacks for everyday carry.

<div id="summary-17" class="summary" style="display: none;">Ghislaine Maxwell cannot be trusted. Support my work: https://www.patreon.com/thehatedone 

Ghislaine Maxwell is doing everything she can to end and escape her punishment. But you must not believe her. Maxwell was the right-hand woman of Jeffrey Epstein to whom she was a girlfriend as well as a top manager of Epstein‚Äôs clandestine trafficking operation.

Now Maxwell is begging the Supreme Court, the Congress as well as the President of the United States to get her conviction overturned, get clemency or an outright pardon. 

This would be a disastrous blow to the criminal justice system as well as a major disservice to the dozens of victims Maxwell was found guilty of abusing along with Epstein. 

But the worst part of this is that some conservative commentators are now claiming that Maxwell might be trusted to tell the truth and they are regurgitating her new line of defense ‚Äì that she wasn‚Äôt a co-conspirator in Epstein‚Äôs criminal enterprise ‚Äì but that she was his victim. [

<div id="summary-29" class="summary" style="display: none;">Why does it feel like our focus is constantly under attack‚Äîand what can we actually do about it? In this episode of the Dual Comm Podcast, we dig into the quiet, everyday battles for our attention, from endless phone scrolling to multitasking ourselves into brain fog. We talk about the lost joy of doing one thing at a time, the value of being bored, and how simple habits‚Äîlike listening to an album start to finish or playing a game without a second screen‚Äîcan help restore our attention span. We also get into the comeback of physical media, why buying CDs and ripping DVDs has become unexpectedly satisfying, and how infinite streaming choice might be making us less happy. Later in the episode, we talk Halo 3 playlist design, why modern FPS games miss the mark on fun, and a productivity warning signal to watch out for. It‚Äôs part nostalgia, part reflection, and part reminder that the best way to protect your focus might be to slow down, log off, and embrace the quiet moments. #gaming #gamingvideos

Created in 1946 for artist and film art director Mischa Kallis, the home embraces the contours of the slope with a dynamic composition of overlapping volumes and carefully placed terraces. After purchasing the home in 2017, homeowners John Gillespie and Susan Orlean embarked on a meticulous, multi-year restoration. Having previously lived in another Schindler-designed residence nearby, they understood the potential hidden beneath years of wear and neglect‚Äîand were committed to bringing the home back to its original brilliance. 

Originally conceived as two distinct structures‚Äîa modest one-bedroom residence and a separate two-bedroom studio‚Äîthe design cleverly linked these spaces via an outdoor terrace that was later enclosed, creating a more cohesive interior environment.Schindler‚Äôs signature architectural language‚Äîbold geometric forms, extensive glazing, and built-in furnishings‚Äîgives the house its sculptural and expressive quality. One of its most distinctive features is a vertical wood-slat screen that runs along the downslope fa√ßade, simultaneously acting as a privacy element and a subtle way to integrate the home into the natural landscape. 

In the 1960s, the home was acquired by members of Kallis‚Äôs extended family, William and Jacqueline Sharlin. Working with architect Josef Van der Kar, a colleague of Schindler‚Äôs, they updated and unified the residence, blending the original two wings into a more fluid living space. Recognized as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument, the Kallis-Sharlin Residence is a powerful reminder of Schindler‚Äôs legacy. It reflects his deep commitment to designing for both the landscape and the individual‚Äîa philosophy that helped shape the Southern California modernist movement.

<div id="summary-47" class="summary" style="display: none;">Are we serious? I continue to receive this complaint from countless clerical staff. Why are we still using fax machines? "Well its HIPPA LAW!" actually with the protocols we need to use to make this ancient technology work with modern day machines, its violating HIPPA law, but what do I know? I just plug in the machine and make it go.At what point are we allowed to remove the dinosaurs from the equation? Are we allowed to say adapt or leave? We pay for encryption for our emails, separate from the already provided encryption. But no I'm sure your fax is more secure right?I'm sure the fax machine is always attended and the POI is never just left sitting in the tray for hours. I'm sure the DOT or DOH or who every you're faxing loves sitting by a fax all day instead of just receiving it in an inbox.I can't with this stupid need to hold on to antiquated things because Judith only knows how to send a fax.submitted by/u/rfisher23[link][comments]</div>

<p class="feed-title">Patch My PC</p>
<button class="toggle-summary-btn" data-target="summary-49">...</button>
<div id="summary-49" class="summary" style="display: none;">Your Intune remote wipe says it worked, but your device still boots like nothing happened. Here‚Äôs why‚Ä¶ and how to fix it before your compliance team panics.

In this episode of Patch Me If You Can, we dive deep into the weird world of ‚Äúphantom wipes‚Äù when Windows pretends to reset but actually does‚Ä¶ nothing.

Turns out, a sneaky component introduced in the May 2025 Windows update (thanks, Recall!) is quietly breaking your remote wipes by failing mid-process. We show you:

‚Ä¢ How to identify a failed remote wipe (even when the portal says it‚Äôs gone)
‚Ä¢ Which logs to check 
‚Ä¢ The exact folder that gives the game away
‚Ä¢ And how a little ‚Äústupid‚Äù file deletion fixed it (yes, really)

Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned Intune admin or just tired of unreliable resets, this is a must-watch tech breakdown, complete with sarcasm, screenshots, and some questionable life choices.

See why over 8,000 organizations trust Patch My PC to handle secure, automated updates.

<div id="summary-50" class="summary" style="display: none;">On July 22, 2025, the European police agency Europol said a long-running investigation led by the French Police resulted in the arrest of a 38-year-old administrator of XSS,¬†a Russian-language cybercrime forum with more than 50,000 members. The action has triggered an ongoing frenzy of speculation and panic among XSS denizens about the identity of the unnamed suspect, but the consensus is that he is a pivotal figure in the crime forum scene who goes by the hacker handle "Toha." Here's a deep dive on what's knowable about Toha, and a short stab at who got nabbed.</div>

<div id="summary-53" class="summary" style="display: none;">"We're trying to show more of who we are." The Belgian brothers unpack their decades-long career and first album in more than seven years.

There are some songs that have become pervasive, nearly universally recognisable features of pop culture. And my guess is that even if you don't know the Belgian duo Soulwax (AKA 2Manydjs) by name, you'll know their biggest hits, like early 2000s indie electronic anthems "E Talking" or "NY Excuse."

In this interview with Resident Advisor editor Gabriel Szatan, the brothers David and Stephen Dewaele talk about their decades-long career and writing their first album in more than seven years, All Systems Are Lying, which they road tested for ages before deciding to put it out. They also unpack bigger thematic arcs in their work and lives: the abiding influence of New Order's Power, Corruption and Lies LP; their creative philosophy ("If it sounds too simple, leave it alone);" and the nature of musical trends and revivals, which have fluctuated intensely since they began performing and releasing records. Listen to the episode in full.

Lately, the weather‚Äôs been moody: aka raining one minute, scorching hot the next. But after a long stretch of rainfall, the sun finally showed up again.

Had to take a few shots of the living room bathed in natural light. There‚Äôs just something about sunlight that makes a space feel alive. ‚òÄÔ∏è

Don‚Äôt forget to step outside and get your daily dose of Vitamin D. Happy midweek, fam!

From Ben Stiller and creator Dan Erickson, Severance centers around Mark Scout (Adam Scott), a leader of a team of office workers whose memories have been surgically divided between their work and personal lives. 

This experiment in ‚Äòwork-life balance‚Äô is called into question as Mark finds himself at the center of an unraveling mystery that will force him to confront the true nature of his work‚Ä¶ and of himself.  

Severance features Adam Scott, who stars alongside Academy-Award winner Patricia Arquette, Emmy-winner John Turturro, Britt Lower, Zach Cherry, Dichen Lachman, Jen Tullock, Tramell Tillman, Michael Chernus and Academy Award winner Christopher Walken.

The design, which has evolved throughout the beta cycle, is expected to remain largely unchanged until the September launch. While minor tweaks are possible, the current state of Liquid Glass is likely to be the final version.submitted by/u/Fer65432_Plays[link][comments]</div>

In the first season of The Buccaneers, a group of fun-loving young American girls exploded into the tightly corseted London of the 1870s ‚Ä¶ setting hearts racing and kicking off an Anglo-American culture clash. Now the Buccaneers are no longer the invaders ‚Äî England is their home. In fact, they‚Äôre practically running the place. Nan is the Duchess of Tintagel, the most influential woman in the country. Conchita is Lady Brightlingsea, heroine to a wave of young American heiresses. And Jinny is on every front page, wanted for the kidnapping of her unborn child. All of the girls have been forced to grow up and now have to fight to be heard, as they wrestle with romance, lust, jealousy, births and deaths ‚Ä¶ themes consuming all women of any age, no matter what year it is. Last time we got a taste of England. This time we‚Äôre in for a veritable feast.

Written by series creator Katherine Jakeways, season two is directed by BAFTA Award winner William McGregor, DGA Award winner Rachel Leiterman, John Hardwick and Charlie Manton. Jakeways, BAFTA Award nominee Beth Willis and BAFTA Award winner Susanna White serve as executive producers. ‚ÄúThe Buccaneers‚Äù is produced for Apple TV+ by The Forge Entertainment, a Banijay UK company.

I‚Äôve posted before -That post where a vendor required installing the same .msi three times to populate a hosts file with SHA-1 fingerprints into AppData?That was me.This post is the culmination of all that - after years of fighting vendor idiocy, management blindness, and IT burnout.Wearing many Hat's the same timeAt the time I quit, I was:Primary responsible for:DACH & BENELUX 1st + 2nd-level supportAD-User ManagementAD-PermissionsGPO-ManagementSSPR, WHfB, LAPS, Conditional Access, RBACAzure App RegistrationsMS-Teams (incl.

For six months.We refused. Turkey is malware central, we deal with Viruses, Trojans, and Cracks on external harddrives every single week. Pausing patches = asking for ransomware.The CTO didn‚Äôt care. He just told me:Do it anyway.I tried to explain how Intune and Office update channels work. He didn‚Äôt even listen.That was the moment I decided to leave.Security Theater 101The same CTO who said "pause Office updates" also:Banned PsExec for "security reasons"Worshipped Secure ScoreHad no clue what Defender for Endpoint actually needs (or how it even works)Refused to license us for anything beyond Microsoft 365 Business Premium and basic Defender for Endpoint licenceBut still wanted full Intune lockdown, security baselines, and brandingWe ran Windows 10 Pro on all clients.No E3. No E5.No advanced threat hunting.No KQL.But he still expected results like we were running an XDR stack on autopilot.Turkey: No Staff, Just Collateral DamageThe Turkey site had no IT staff.Instead, two programmers - actually hired for programming arround ERP - were forced to manage:FirewallsServersMalware cleanupSoftware updatesLocal user supportInfrastructure issues they weren‚Äôt even trained forTheir "IT manager"? Delegated everything.

<div id="summary-101" class="summary" style="display: none;">A new Trump administration plan will require travelers from certain countries to pay a bond of up to $15,000 before getting a tourist or business visa to enter the U.S. The move from the State Department may make the process unaffordable for many.

The department said it would start a 12-month pilot program under which people from countries deemed to have high overstay rates and deficient internal document security controls could be required to post bonds of $5,000, $10,000 or $15,000 when they apply for a visa.

The proposal comes as the Trump administration is tightening requirements for visa applicants. Last week, the State Department announced that many visa renewal applicants would have to submit to an additional in-person interview, something that was not required in the past.

The countries affected will be listed once the program takes effect. The bond could be waived depending on an applicant‚Äôs individual circumstances.</div>

<div id="summary-108" class="summary" style="display: none;">Asked to setup SSO with Entra for a new application that we are bringing on. No problem, give me the documentation and I'll get it done. The response from the vendor: Sorry we don't have documentation and cannot help you for legal reasons. Just contact Microsoft and they can help you.What? I had to pull out some info like the attributes & claims, and urls, and still not sure what the hell else is needed. I told my supervisor how unusual this is and that I can't just guess on what they need. They made simple, hard! Thanks for that.submitted by/u/rurbaniak14[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-132" class="summary" style="display: none;">The threat never left, it evolved. Invasion Season 3 premieres August 22 on Apple TV+
https://apple.co/_Invasion

Invasion follows an alien invasion through different perspectives around the world. In season three, those perspectives collide for the first time, as the series‚Äô main characters are brought together to work as a team on a critical mission to infiltrate the alien mothership. The ultimate apex aliens have finally emerged, rapidly spreading their deadly tendrils across the planet. It will take all heroes working together, using their experience and expertise, to save the species. New relationships are formed, old relationships are challenged and even shattered, as an international cast of characters must become a team before it‚Äôs too late.

The third season of Invasion stars returning cast members Golshifteh Farahani, Shioli Kutsuna, Shamier Anderson, India Brown, Shane Zaza and Enver Gjokaj, and introduces new series regular Erika Alexander.

Invasion is created by Kinberg and Weil, who also serve as executive producers alongside Audrey Chon, David Witz, Alik Sakharov, Dan Dietz, Katie O‚ÄôConnell Marsh and Nick Nantell. 

Following its global debut, Invasion has been hailed for ‚Äúupping the ante‚Äù with each season as well as expert cinematography that ‚Äúcaptures the beauty and eeriness‚Äù of an alien invasion. The first and second seasons of Invasion are now streaming globally on Apple TV+.

<div id="summary-134" class="summary" style="display: none;">I work for a gov office, we have a pretty complex network with a lot of new mixed with old solutions (we're working on it!), but not too messy as we keep things pretty tidy.About 2 months ago things just started.....crashing. When I say things I mean such various things we simply had no idea what was going on. Randomly, parts of completely unrelated systems started crashing. For example a geographic piece of software we run maps on and a storage replica that have nothing to do with each other. This spanned literally anything that has an relation to Windows.Around the same time we started noticing Workstation service is crashing on some of the affected clients and services, but this was pretty rare so we never gave it too much thought even though I literally never saw this service crash in my 10 years here.Now lets go back about a year ago, back then I noticed some servers and clients are failing to update their group policy. A quick google landed me in C:\Windows\System32\GroupPolicy. Delete the contents and the issue goes away. I proceeded to create a SCCM baseline which finds the failed GPUpdate event, and if that happens it just deletes the content of said folder and runs gpupdate /force. This fixed around 95% of the problems. Rarely this didn't manage to fix the issue, at which point we usually fixed manually. My boss decided this is no good and 2 months ago asked our junior SCCM guy to come up with a better solution.You can see where this is going. Junior went to some AI which spat out 2 pieces of PowerShell code, junior applied code in the scripts of said SCCM baseline and went home happy. The code.... It changed the event that decides when to run the remediation script to any event concerning an issue with gpupdate, including warnings, and in the remediation script, on top of a mountain of unneeded BS it contained the following 2 lines:Restart-Service Netlogon -ForceRestart-Service Workstation -ForceThere are a lot of other services that depend on these 2 services and they also depend on each other, and of course things just started falling apart. I can't tell you how many hours of debugging went into this. Global support teams we alerted, product groups running insane debugging tools, we canceled storage replicas, clusters, reinstalled whole RDS farms etc etc etc.6 weeks later I caught a service failing as I was there with procmon running, and saw the script it was running and the folder the script came from. I managed to work my way from there to the baseline.The junior was not fired, even though if he only asked any one of us we would never allow such a script to run.Oh and did I mention, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T BLINDLY TRUST AI ANSWERS.submitted by/u/StrikerXTZ[link][comments]</div>

Data brokers know where you go, what you search, and when you are ‚Äúin-market‚Äù for big-ticket items. In this video I show how location and identity signals are harvested and sold, with real examples from broker marketing and an airport case study that aligns shopping with travel using identity matching and real-time personalised services. I also highlight a serious privacy incident where purchased app location data was used to publicly out someone.

If you want to reduce this exposure, you can try manual removals or use DeleteMe. I personally use DeleteMe to remove my data from 750 data broker sites. Use my link for 20% off: https://joindeleteme.com/bombal

<div id="summary-141" class="summary" style="display: none;">If you are asking the question "Should I switch to Bazzite?" then the simple answer is,ABSO-FREAKING-LUTELY!https://preview.redd.it/aubdzxf3b7hf1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=312f0bd97690c0e0b0db878c7e6377096dbb28c5I was fed up with Windows + WSL2 set up on my desktop. It has so many limitations, bugs and simply just broken in some cases. I have a M4 MacBook Air as well and it's a decent experience but I'm not an Apple person so part of the Apple experience is irrelevant to me.I had a few primary blockers for me in terms of switching to Linux. Linux being Linux wasn't one because I've been using WSL2 Ubuntu distro for quite a while and I've played around with a few Debian based distros on and off (although 80% of my experience is with Ubuntu). I am ok with the terminal and occasional time consuming troubleshoots.My main blockers were:Can I bring all my Dev tools exactly as is to Linux?Can I get Claude Desktop working with MCP support on Linux (because there's no official package)?Can I use Adobe Illustrator on Linux?Can I play World of Warcraft on Linux?Can I use Office 365 on Linux?Can I have a decent multimedia experience without any annoying driver issues, codec issues or just simply broken media experience?Enter Bazzite! A comprehensive solution for my issues.My desktop specs:Ryzen 3700x32GB RAMRTX 3060 12GB GPUMSI MAG B550 Mortar mainboard with WiFi and BluetoothI went with theBazzite Nvidia KDE Desktopedition and then revised it to theBazzite DX Nvidia KDEedition. (Never rebase cross desktop environments i.e.: KDE and GNOME, is what experts say so sure, I'd say the same thing. Anyway, why would you want to ruin your clean distro installation in the first place?)1. Dev Tools and the Dev environmentWith Bazzite DX, VS Code, Podman and Docker comes with the base and I get homebrew built in as well with Distrobox also in the base to cover for containerisation. (Containerisation is quite important as I've learned and more about it a bit later). I've made Podman the primary engine as it doesn't have root access requirements and is generally more secure and slightly better performance too.I use Cursor most of the time and there's an Appimage route to get Cursor working on Bazzite with almost no hassle at all using Gear Lever.Terminal. Now this is a very important part of the overall Dev experience. You want to feel comfortable with your terminal and you want to feel excited to use it. I usually go with zsh as my shell and ohmyzsh for the prompt with powerlevel10k theme and catppuccin mocha colours. Since I'm changing my setup, I decided to venture out and see what other options are out there.My new terminal, is the default KDE terminal. nothing fancy there. it seems like a decent enough terminal and I'm fine with it. The shell however, I switched to Fish! Its different. There indeed is a learning curve because the bash/zsh commands that I know may not work on fish. Curl installation commands is a challenge I encountered almost immediately and I still need to learn how to use it properly. But the good news is, worst case scenario, i can always bash it (which is what i did with the curl commands but I'm sure many people here would 'educate' me on how stupid I'm being without learning how to use fish properly, and yes, I will, eventually, gradually, but the workaround, WORKS and I just want to let another newbie know that).So... FISH. Well, what can I say, I like it! Especially the functions. After setting up a few functions and using it for about an hour or so, let me tell you,I'm never going back to any other shell ever again!(jk. I have to go back to bash once in a while because I'm fish noob and don't know how to properly write the fish compatible commands yet.) But seriously, I'm all in with fish and I have only scraped the surface yet I'm already impressed by how usable and feature rich it is. Highly recommended switching to fish. (first function or abbreviation you should setup is the cd functions to your most visited folders.)Next up, is the prompt. Nothing fancy there, just Homebrew Starship and did my own custom version of the Catppuccin Powerline preset (https://starship.rs/presets/catppuccin-powerline). You can try it out from here -https://github.com/hashangit/hashangit-starship-config. It's pretty, and fairly easy to customise with so many plug-in options also available to choose from. One thing I noticed is that you can't use the [git_branch], [git_status] plug-in to conditionally switch colour based on if the branch is in sync or out of sync. I would have loved to have it change to green if in sync with origin and yellow if not but, I couldn't find a way to do it. So I'm configured it to show changes vs show nothing using the [git_status] plug-in instead for now. (any feedback is welcome!)Alright, Let's get to the fun part!ContainerisationBazzite is an immutable Linux distro (more like built on top of an immutable Fedora but same difference). This is a good thing AND at the same time, it means you need a bit of extra attention when setting everything up. OS base being immutable is great and you should try your very best to keep it that way, for security as well as to prevent YOU, YOURSELF, out of ignorance, destroying your own os installation. Latter is the more important thing for someone like myself, who doesn't really know the ins and outs but learn by fiddling around. But you can gain system level access if you want, with rpm-ostree, but, so far, i haven't had the need to. Homebrew is available and it, as far as I understand, has separation already so it shouldn't affect the base os, meaning I, and also You can't destroy your system out of ignorance.So then how do you get things done in scenarios where you need system level access? Easy.SWITCH TO UBUNTU!No what I actually meant is, get an Ubuntu based container running on Distrobox and get your development enviornment setup there with your tools and dependencies. At this point, I'm sure the experts are just screaming out of their heads, telling me how wrong my approach is, and yes, I have the IDEs etc setup on my host and I have my runtimes and dependencies and and other tools setup in the container, and I'm exporting them out to the host. Is it the best way? perhaps not. Does it work just fine for my workflows? So far YES! without a hitch. So for now, this is perfectly fine as far as I'm concerned. You could have all your different projects isolated into their own individual containers including al the tools like IDEs etc but, I thought that is too much for my specific requirement. Ionly really work with JS, TS, python for NextJS, ExpressJS, NodeJS, React/ React Native, different python projects (all isolated with venv and potery) and that's about it for now so really, my requirements aren't too complex to warrant a more complex isolation approach per project. In fact, being able to use the same pnpm store across project, helps a lot in my case as I have a metered internet connection. I can write up a guide based on how I did my setup IF enough people need me to but, to be honest, getting Claude to write a custom guide for your specific scenario would be the better approach (which is what I did. I had no clue whatsoever on what I'm suppose to do in the first place when I thought of switching to Bazzite)That brings me to the next important thing in my list.Claude Desktop2. Getting Claude Desktop with MCP support to work on BazziteTruth be told, I am no expert in this. I mean I am an expert in USING Claude but not in terms of turning an electron windows app into a Linux app. So all the credit should go to the original developer on making it a really simple painless process to get Claude Desktop working with MCP supportON UBUNTU!. Alright, I'm sure you can see where I'm going with this. Just install it into the ubuntu container and export the app out to the host just like we did with pnpm, node, etc.. it just works and the instructions are so very clear and simple.Thank YouEsmiand Thank YouAaddrickHere's the link to the repo that I used:https://github.com/emsi/claude-desktop/tree/mainHere's the link to the original repo which the above one is based on:https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian3. Adobe Illustrator on LinuxApparently, this is not possible and Adobe doesn't seem to have any real intention to bring Adobe suite to Linux, at all, ever. So that's that! Honestly, I use Illustrator quite rarely as of late in my workflows (Thank You Canva) so this is nota major blocker for me anymore. I have 3 options available. I can use Illustrator on my MacBook or, I can temporarily switch to my old Windows installation for just that or I can run Windows on a VM on Bazzite and run Illustrator on that. Honestly, using Ilustrator on my MacBook is the easiest, most painless route so yeah, I don't think I'm going to bother with 'Adobe on Linux' battle.4. World of Warcraft Retail on LinuxNow, here's the funny thing. WoW Windows game works better on Linux compared to Windows! ü´≥üèΩüé§ Setting up is quite simple. The route that worked for me out of the box with no issues, is Lutris route. Bazzite comes with Lutris pre-installed. Just search forBattle.netin Lutris and install. But first, you gotta do a couple of small things.Get ProtonPlus via BazaarOn ProtonPlus, switch to Lutris from Steam on the top left corner. Scroll down to Wine, and download 'Wine-Staging-Tkg (Kron4ek)'. Anything after v10.6 works apparently and I'm using v10.12 which works in August 2025 (before retail 11.2 patch. PTR 11.2 works so no reason why 11.2 shouldn't work).Next, on Lutris, Preferences > Runners > Wine > runner Options > Wine Version and seect the newly downloaded version. Alternatively, if you have already downloadedBattle.net, you can right click, Configure > Runner Options > Wine Version and select the latest version you just downloaded. You can double-check to see if DXVK and VKD3D are enabled because you need to have those enabled.Now you can go ahead and run Battle.net. Just make sure to read what the wizaed says and do as mentioned. You want it to download the Battle.net Update Agent then run it and go all the way until the login window is presented.DON NOT LOGIN RIGHT NOW!Let's Lutris finish the installation properly.Once Lutris completes the full installation, then you can launchBattle.netand login.Now, if you are coming from Windows, and already have your game files on Windows, and don't want to download the game files again, well, you are in luck! but, you need to first do a couple of things. You need to log into your windows installation (probably for the last time in your life) and turn off 'Fast Start Up' which you may need to do through Powershell now because the control Panel and Settings aren't showing the option anymore (at least in my case) and turn off any other settings that cause the ntfs-3g driver on Linux to prevent you from mouting the Windows installation with full read / write permissions (a simple Google search can give you all the information you need on this.). This is required if your WoW game files are saved on the same drive as your Windows installation.Now, Bazite should be able to easily mount the NTFS drive with your WoW game files and you can just do this via Dolphin (file browser) itsel. (Remember to double-check if its mounted with out and write restrictions). Now its just a matter of updating the game files folder onBattle.netclient just like you normally would on Windows and point to the game files folder on the NTFS partition. This works just fine without any issues whatsoever. But the recommended way is to copy the game files folder onto your btrfs drive for best perfomance. But, personally, I'd keep it as is, just in case, if WoW has issues on Bazzite (unlikely) for some reason (even Blizzard has confirmed that while they don't officially support Linux, they would not intentionally break it either.)Launch the game and start your adventures in Azeroth and K'aresh from where you left off! (Or in Outland. Your choice. I'm not judging.)5. Office 365 on Linux.Outright, this doesn't work. But its the same story like the Adobe Illustrator. Google workspace EXISTS! And the Office 365 broswer version is adequate in most cases. If strictly need Office 365, I can use it on my MacBook, or switch to Windows for a it temporarily. Also, from my experience, Libre Office applications are more than capable and is a decent user experience unless you strictly want the Microsoft vesion for some strange reason. So this is not and issue, at least for me.6. The multimedia experienceSimple answer is, Bazzite multimedia experience (atealst in my case) isFantastic!I tried out Ubuntu 25.04 when it came out, on my Desktop, and the audio quality was bad and it sounded tinny and no bass. On Windows, since I'm using a bluetooth speaker, there's a delay between the video and audio which completely destroys the media experience. On Bazzite though, I have no such issues. Audio is deep and rich with proper bass and while i have not yet gotten to it, there are easy to use system-wide EQ tools to tune it up to your exact preference. My Speakers have SBC codec and Bazzit is correctly picking and using the SBC codec for best possible output. I have a dual 2k + 1080p monitor setup. While they are not high refresh rate monitors, I'm not seeing anything wrong with the visual experience compared to what I see on Windows and when i connect my MacBook to the same monitors. Onething I've noticed is that the default setting is to let the monitor manage the colour accuracy so if you have 2 different monitors (especially 2 different brands and 2 different panel tech like mine with HP and Samsung) you'll see the same thing in different colours. This for me is acceptable and i think depending on your monitor's capabilities, you might be able to make them lookalike with a bit a tweaking in the display configuration.So, should you switch to Bazzite?YES. It's better than Windowssubmitted by/u/Designer_Athlete7286[link][comments]</div>

Every few years, someone declares the end of moviegoing. First it was cable, then VHS, then DVDs, streaming, and even COVID. And yet ‚Äî the big screen persists.

Sure, the landscape has changed. Since 2019, the U.S. has lost nearly 5,000 movie theater screens. Big chains have struggled financially. Alamo Drafthouse, once independent, was recently acquired by Sony Pictures. And Netflix‚Äôs Ted Sarandos famously claimed that moviegoing is an ‚Äúoutdated concept.‚Äù

But people still love going to the movies ‚Äî and independent movie theater owners are meeting that passion head-on.

Across the country, independent cinemas are reimagining what it means to be a theater. From inventive programming and community events to affordable tickets and local partnerships, they‚Äôre creating experiences that go far beyond just watching a film.

We sat down with Emelyn Stuart (Stuart Cinema), Matthew Viragh (Nitehawk Cinemas), and Thaddeus Bouchard (Screendollars) to explore how these theaters are thriving ‚Äî and why the industry isn‚Äôt on life support just yet.

No other issues.This probobly changed when I used rpm-ostree rollback. I wasn t able to load bazzite it would just freeze like for 3 times in a row than it loaded. I thought an update broke my system since the previous ostree 1 worked fine for a while.

Some experimentation followed, and now I'm back with my findings.In my post I show and explain how I tried to make LLMs squirm and reveal what they shouldn't. I think you're going to appreciate a unique angle of my approach.I describe how, under certain conditions, LLMs can see the user as a "trusted interlocutor", and open up. An interesting behavior emerging from some models can be observed.submitted by/u/Xayan[link][comments]</div>

But that was just the beginning of his hacking career. When he stumbled into the terrifying (and perfectly legal) world of data brokers, he built a pipeline for identity theft on a massive scale.

But why are these companies even allowed to exist? And who are they selling all our personal data to, anyway? What Hieu uncovered might change how your look at the world.

"i refuse to boot windows no matter how much of an inconvenience it is." So many of these people are just incoherent and just scream 'use linux' regardless of anyones scenario. you need adobe? 'youre an idiot use something else open source, who cares if its good or fits your needs'. I really want to play Fortnite or BF6. 'you are so dumb for playing a game thats not supported on linux.' you know what? its OK to use Windows. life is too short and putting up some sort of wild stance about an operating system is so insanely stupid. and everyone who tries to force someone one way or another for an operating system? needs to re-evaluate their life choices.Use whatever operating system youd like to play the games you want to play.99% of everyone crying about microsoft and their privacy are using gmail, google search, reddit, X. ALL of these are just as intrusive or more to your privacy.oh you dont like microsoft controlling your patching and reboots? all you CachyOs or any Arch people need to patch and reboot way more often than windows makes you reboot or your system will break.look. im a more often than not a linux user/gamer but its OK to use windows. i use it for VR cause its just better all around 100%. if i feel the need to play BR6, ill just boot Windows if i feel like it. it doesnt need to be this boycott cause in the end, its only harming you. this will not change the narrativesubmitted by/u/typhon88[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-183" class="summary" style="display: none;">More than 50 Texas House Democrats left the state Sunday, one day after a bill that would dramatically redraw Texas‚Äô congressional maps passed a state legislative committee in the GOP-led House of Representatives.
The Texas House requires 100 members be present to conduct business, and the House only includes 88 Republicans. The Democrats‚Äô action, known as ‚Äúbreaking quorum,‚Äù effectively brings the House to a standstill and prevents any consideration of the bill by the full chamber.

The heavily redrawn congressional maps, which are backed by President Trump, could give Republicans five extra seats in the midterm elections. House Democratic Caucus Chair Gene Wu spoke in a Chicago suburb, flanked by fellow House Democrats and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker.

‚ÄúIf Donald Trump is allowed to do this, if he is allowed to, once again, cheat and get away with it, there is no stopping this. This will spread across the country.‚Äù

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said that if those Democrats who have broken quorum do not return to the Capitol immediately, he will invoke a ruling by state Attorney General Ken Paxton to have them expelled from the Texas House.</div>

New time-stops have been added.They are making the model even less sycophantic. Previously, it heavily agreed with what the user said.Nowthe model will recognize delusions and emotional dependency and correct them.OpenAI Details:Learning from expertsWe‚Äôre working closely with experts to improve how ChatGPT responds in critical moments‚Äîfor example, when someone shows signs of mental or emotional distress.Medical expertise.We worked with over 90 physicians across over 30 countries‚Äîpsychiatrists, pediatricians, and general practitioners ‚Äî to build custom rubrics for evaluating complex, multi-turn conversations.Research collaboration.We're engaging human-computer-interaction (HCI) researchers and clinicians to give feedback on how we've identified concerning behaviors, refine our evaluation methods, and stress-test our product safeguards.Advisory group.We‚Äôre convening an advisory group of experts in mental health, youth development, and HCI. This group will help ensure our approach reflects the latest research and best practices.On healthy useSupporting you when you‚Äôre struggling.ChatGPT is trained to respond with grounded honesty. There have been instances where our 4o model fell short in recognizing signs of delusion or emotional dependency. While rare, we're continuing to improve our models and are developing tools to better detect signs of mental or emotional distress so ChatGPT can respond appropriately and point people to evidence-based resources when needed.Keeping you in control of your time.Starting today, you‚Äôll see gentle reminders during long sessions to encourage breaks. We‚Äôll keep tuning when and how they show up so they feel natural and helpful.Helping you solve personal challenges. When you ask something like ‚ÄúShould I break up with my boyfriend?‚Äù ChatGPT shouldn‚Äôt give you an answer. It should help you think it through‚Äîasking questions, weighing pros and cons. New behavior for high-stakes personal decisions is rolling out soon.https://openai.com/index/how-we're-optimizing-chatgpt/submitted by/u/ldsgems[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-188" class="summary" style="display: none;">Just had one of those infuriating "WTF, Microsoft?" moments. We run a production mail system through Azure Communication Services (ACS) Email, which, as documented (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/email/email-overview), is completely separate from Exchange Online. It‚Äôs an authenticated mail service using App Registrations, no connectors, no direct send, no relation to EXO transport pipeline at all.So what happens when we (responsibly) enable RejectDirectSend in Exchange Online to harden domain spoofing protections?Mail flow from ACS Email dies.Not a hiccup. Not a delay. A full-on "message rejected" scenario as if we were doing unauthenticated direct send, which we're not.Open a case with Microsoft support, and I get a politely worded, totally useless response that boils down to:"Yeah that‚Äôs expected. Direct Send from accepted domains gets blocked when you flip the switch. Configure a connector or disable it."WHAT CONNECTOR? What are you even talking about?!ACS Email is not an Exchange Online workload. It authenticates through Azure, not Exchange. It doesn‚Äôt use direct send, and there‚Äôs no way to configure a connector for it in Exchange Online, nor should there be. This is literally Microsoft breaking their own mail platform with another Microsoft product‚Äôs security feature.How do you even QA this kind of thing?So now we‚Äôre in a position where a global mail solution billed as enterprise-grade and scalable for apps/services is dependent on Exchange Online not having one specific setting enabled, a setting that‚Äôs there to prevent spoofing.Let me say that again: a security feature in EXO breaks Microsoft‚Äôs own separate, authenticated, app-to-email service.The cherry on top: Support telling us to ‚Äúconfigure a partner connector‚Äù and ‚Äúcheck SPF.‚Äù As if this were a traditional SMTP relay scenario.No. This is a secure, authenticated service designed for cloud-first applications. You broke it by accident, and the response is basically, "Oops, sorry."This is the kind of crap that makes IT pros want to jump ship and go live in the woods.Microsoft: Either separate your services properly or document the fact that internal product lines can silently brick each other.And no, I will not be ‚Äútemporarily disabling‚Äù domain spoofing protections because you couldn‚Äôt design your systems to talk to each other.Unacceptablesubmitted by/u/Intrepid_Chard_3535[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-189" class="summary" style="display: none;">In case you haven't already heard, EA has decided to actively block Proton, Wine or SteamDeck from running their brand new shooter, as they have already done for other titles of the saga, such as BF1.After the Windows 11 debacle and many users quitting Windows seemingly forever after being forced to buy new hardware to feed Bill Gates' already full pockets. it would be a step back for everyone in the Linux community and otherwise to simply roll over and take it up the ass when it comes to this new occurrence.I've already heard people in other subreddits pushing users to dual-boot what is essentially spy- and ad-ware on their machines, because there will be no other way to play this game, not only because EA and DICE are incompetent enough to produce anticheat that support Proton (much like EasyAntiCheat has been able to do forever) but also because they outright don't give a fuck about us users.I don't only refer to Linux users in the previous sentence, but to every single user of a PC anywhere in the world. What do EA care if you choose to play their brand spanking new game that costs 70 bucks on any hardware of your choosing? Why require SecureBoot to run the game? Are they that incompetent? Yes, but not only that, as I've already said! They simply don't give a fuck about consumers, and just want to make a quick buck out of you!We must all rise to the occasion by boycotting this game to show this company that their extortion techniques will be met with nothing less than outright war.Thank you very much for coming to my TED talk.EDIT:I'm told Bill Gates only owns 1% of Microsoft now. I extend my deeply felt hatred to all corpos running that particular company and all others that seek to destroy consumers in their endless greed. This includes, of course, Nvidia for refusing to collaborate in making open-source drivers for their cards unlike what AMD has been able to do.EDIT 2:Since I keep on seeing some points repeated over and over in the comment section, I would like to clarify my position on these.I didn't expect this post to have that much impact in the general PC community anyway. It was meant more as a reflection into how giving up on Windows after the Windows 11 debacle and then going back to dual-booting might not be an option for some users given they might not be unable to install Windows 11 at all, which is a kick in the face for consumers.There are (at least) two big camps of people in the comment section. One part says "LOL just dual boot". Again, this might not be an option for some people, and even if it is, it's a kick in the face to have to do so.Another camp says "is it really a boycott if Linux doesn't support it so we can't install it?" I know, that's the point behind the post, the idea of reinstalling Windows (if you are able to do so) just to play this game is stupid in my eyes, hence I made this rant post. Some people might feel inclined to do so, and I wanted to give them a counterargument against that decision.Once again, I don't expect 4% of the PC playerbase "boycotting" (or simply not being able to install) this game to have any impact, of course not, but it doesn't personally feel right to pay 70 bucks for a game I can't run on my machine unless I use what has turned out to be adware and spyware. It doesn't feel right to support outright incompetence/malice by giving them my money so they can run code within my computer's kernel because they can't / don't care enough to come up with a better solution. I know I'm preaching to the converted, just wanted to voice my opinion and reasoning once again.EDIT 3:To anyone thinking I'm somehow forcing people to boycott this game or do anything at all, I have no power over anyone, especially over the Internet, since I'm no Jedi. You sure better contact the Council if you think you have the ability to do so, but that ain't me. I also have no intention of turning "this" (this subreddit? this Linux community? I really don't know...) into a religion or a cult by imposing my views, as some commenters have stated.To everyone: kindly do whatever you want, I'm not holding you at gunpoint, I just wanted to voice my take.submitted by/u/ChemiCalChems[link][comments]</div>

In this soulful Toronto apartment tour, Lisa invites us into her colorful and story-rich home located in the heart of the city. Opting for the character of an older building over a modern condo, Lisa has crafted a space that functions as a personal art gallery, championing the work of Black, POC, and local Toronto artists. This home is a stunning example of intentional maximalism, where every object and art piece is chosen with purpose and tells a part of her story.

The tour begins in a welcoming entryway featuring vibrant art celebrating Black girlhood, setting the tone for a home filled with identity and pride. From a tiny bathroom with unique vintage flooring to a cozy bedroom built around a cherished antique nightstand, personal history is woven into the fabric of the decor. The living room is the apartment's centerpiece, featuring a stunning gallery wall with works by artists like Mark Stoddart and Attos Setu, each piece holding deep significance. Across the room, colorful paintings by Kalkidan Assefa and Quinton Versetti bring the vibrancy of Toronto inside.

Beyond the art, this tour is packed with inspiration for small space living. See how Lisa created a dedicated dining nook, uses a bookcase to display her love for literature (spines out!), and seamlessly integrates her cat's needs with stylish, functional furniture. From her views on displaying family photos to her love for the nostalgia of fridge magnets and memories of Honest Ed's, Lisa's tour is more than just interior design. It's a lesson in how to build a home that is a sanctuary of personal expression, community, and heritage.

<div id="summary-201" class="summary" style="display: none;">I have a question: How many ants would it take to lift a person? We asked experts!

Let‚Äôs assume we use the world‚Äôs strongest ant, the leaf cutter ant...

The answer is a surprisingly small number of ants, considering a leaf cutter colony can have over 8 million.

BUT you probably wont get kidnapped by ants any time soon.

This feature can help reduce stutter especially when using virtual reality. This feature was originally introduced in the r570 series. It can be disabled by loading nvidia.ko with the \NVreg_RegistryDwords=RMIntrLockingMode=0` kernel module parameter.`Implemented another feature that can reduce time spent in the interrupt top half for low latency display interrupts by deferring the work until later. This feature is experimental and disabled by default. This feature can be enabled by loading nvidia.ko with the \NVreg_RegistryDwords=RmEnableAggressiveVblank=1` kernel module parameter.`Fixed a bug that could cause blank rendering on some single-buffered GLX applications when running on Xwayland.Fixed a bug that could cause a kernel use-after-free on pre-Turing GPUs.Fixed a bug that could cause OpenGL applications and compositors to stall when using NVIDIA as a PRIME Display Offload sink ("Reverse PRIME"), potentially resulting in a black screen.Fixed a bug that led to increasing memory usage in X11 OpenGL and Vulkan applications after suspend/resume cycles.Fixed a bug that could cause 32-bit x86 applications running on recent builds of glibc to crash on dlopen().submitted by/u/DAUNTINGY[link][comments]</div>

From the updated visuals and enemy design to the massive overhaul of soupers and abilities, to the tone and structure, this might be the spiritual reboot Destiny has needed. Here's a breakdown of what stood out, what NetEase got right, and what this means for the future of the franchise.

In 2025, cybersecurity has entered ‚ÄúAI vs AI, episode one.‚Äù In this conversation, we discuss why attackers currently have the advantage, how AI hacking agents can bypass scraping defences and anti-scraper tooling, and why zero-click style attacks against key infrastructure are an emerging risk. We also outline the defender‚Äôs path to shift the balance back, and why this race won‚Äôt stop.

<div id="summary-229" class="summary" style="display: none;">Guys, if you're going to run docker on an enterprise environment, talk to your network folks. Don't just pick a non default IP space because you think the default will cause problems.Network guy here, we carved out the default 172.16.0.0/16 space for you to do what you will in your private docker instances. We will never make an enterprise network in this space. But you went and changed your docker IP scheme to 172.60.0.0/16 and black-holed a whole building from being able to use your application. Why would you do that? This is the only docker network running on this machine, there was genuinely no reason to change it.Now I have users that are complaining and blaming network when an application guy decided to change default for the sake of changing default.Edit: 172.60.0.0/16 is just a random IP I pulled out of my ass. We're not actually using it.submitted by/u/nick99990[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-232" class="summary" style="display: none;">The internet was supposed to set us free. But somewhere along the way, it became a tool for surveillance, extraction, and control. What happened? And is there still time to reclaim the weird, untapped potential of the digital world?

This week, Sean is joined by Douglas Rushkoff. He‚Äôs a media theorist, author of Survival of the Richest and Team Human, and host of the Team Human podcast. They trace the arc of the internet from its utopian beginnings to its corporate capture, and explore what it would take to build something different. Along the way, they talk about the loss of weirdness, the logic of capitalism, the dangers of scale, and the difference between systems thinking and systems feeling. They also reflect on whether it‚Äôs still possible to use technology to foster a more connected and communal life.

Now I was hoping it could help me with the VRAM issues I am facing on Forza Horizon 5. Lo and behold! I was barely hitting the 4GB limit of my RX 570 and has been getting better fps lows than on Windows even at Medium settings!

<div id="summary-240" class="summary" style="display: none;">Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but I get a feeling there‚Äôs a lot of non-Systems Administrators posting here trying to get by without hiring a real IT team. I think this violates the community rules, as this isn‚Äôt an outside troubleshooting forum; it‚Äôs a forum of Systems Administrators helping each other out, complaining about our jobs, and just anything we all go through. With all of the IT cuts and AI push, I don‚Äôt think this should be the forum that allows this. Also, it should be fairly obvious who doesn‚Äôt know the IT basics and just had some meetings to find out enough to seem to know what they‚Äôre talking about.submitted by/u/iwantdatgold[link][comments]</div>

<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQnZkuAZEDI" target="_blank">Building geothermal homestead with stone-dome & full ecosystem (Alicante) üåøüêü</a></h2>
<p class="published-date">2025-08-03 15:59:29</p>
<p class="feed-title">Kirsten Dirksen</p>
<button class="toggle-summary-btn" data-target="summary-256">...</button>
<div id="summary-256" class="summary" style="display: none;">This homestead includes two handcrafted natural homes, a geodesic dome greenhouse built from local stone, a hand-dug stream, two natural swimming ponds, a bamboo maze, and a thriving permaculture garden and orchard with over 2,000 plants. It‚Äôs a place where the home doesn‚Äôt just shelter you‚Äîit feeds you, cools and heats itself, filters your air, and invites you to slow down and live well.

It‚Äôs the work of Vicente Nadal, a pioneer in natural building in his part of Spain, Pa√≠s Valenci√†. Tucked away in a quiet canyon near Alicante‚Äîjust beyond the bustle of the Mediterranean coast‚Äî he‚Äôs blending ancient building knowledge with smart, low-tech innovation. Vicente believes the future lies in remembering what we've forgotten: using local materials, designing with the climate, and creating homes that actually give back.

Here, nearly everything is made from stone, lime, and wood found on the land. The main house‚Äîonce a plain stucco structure‚Äîis now full of organic curves and warmth, with thick walls that insulate and sculpted heated benches built into the design. The smaller home features a clever modular wall system that converts the open-plan studio into a two-bedroom layout in seconds. The dome greenhouse is not only functional, but striking‚Äîbuilt by hand with lime mortar and wood for growing food year-round.

Vicente designs homes that blend with nature and are health-enhancing. He uses lime plasters and paints inside and out, which naturally absorb CO‚ÇÇ, filter indoor air, and resist mold and bacteria. For cooling, a DIY ‚ÄúCanadian Well‚Äù system (AKA earth-coupled air cooling system) brings in fresh air from underground. For heating, thermal inertia stoves made with natural materials release warmth slowly over 24 hours using minimal wood‚Äîheating both the space and the built-in seating with efficiency and beauty.

The land is shaped to support water and life: a meandering stream crosses under a stone Roman-style bridge, feeding two deep, natural ponds that help filter water and provide a habitat for frogs, dragonflies, and fish. There‚Äôs even an outdoor limestone shower that, four years on, still looks like new‚Äîthanks to limestone‚Äôs natural resistance to stains and microbes.

Even the finishing touches are rooted in local wisdom. Esparto blinds hang on the outside of windows, blocking harsh summer sun while letting in dappled light‚Äîand on hot days, they can be misted to cool the air that enters the home. A treehouse built from leftover wood and salvaged windows, a mountain bike trail, and winding paths through the orchard show how joy, play, and function all coexist here. 

For Vicente, this kind of building isn‚Äôt a niche lifestyle‚Äîit‚Äôs a return to sanity. When you treat your home as an ecosystem, it becomes something that supports your health, grows your food, powers your comfort, and connects you to the land.

<p class="published-date">2025-08-03 11:51:19</p>
<p class="feed-title">Exploring Alternatives</p>
<button class="toggle-summary-btn" data-target="summary-264">...</button>
<div id="summary-264" class="summary" style="display: none;">Alex and Al started off as friends who decided to help each other build their own separate tiny homes, side by side.  But by the time their tiny home walls were framed, they had fallen in love.  So, they decided to build one of the tiny homes for them both to live in, and they finished and sold the other tiny house to help cover some of their expenses.  They‚Äôve been together for almost 6 years now and just recently got married!  They are still living in the tiny house together and say that it is even better than they hoped it would be!

You can follow and find out more about Alex's weaving at Alex Rooted here:

https://www.alexrooted.com/

Their tiny house was built on a 24‚Äô long trailer, and it has 2‚Äô bump outs at each end, bringing the total length to 28‚Äô.  The width is 8.5‚Äô, and the height is 13.5‚Äô.  The trailer they used is from Iron Eagle, and they chose it because the floor of the trailer is sunken down which provides some much needed vertical inches to make sure they had enough head room on the main floor and up in the loft.

Alex and Al tried to use as many reclaimed and local materials as possible to reduce waste on the project, including using salvaged cedar shingles and planks for their siding, flooring from an old bowling alley, and locally milled wood.  For their interior walls, they used Wedi board and plastered it with venetian plaster for a stunning finish.

Storage and space to cook were two major priorities with their design, so they have 38 large drawers to make sure they can keep the tiny space organized, and they have loads of counter space in the galley kitchen for preparing large meals and canning preserves.

Alex and Al heat their tiny home with wood, and they made sure to get their wood stove WETT certified.  Another thing they did to help make sure they could get home insurance was to skirt their tiny home and remove the wheels.  By doing this, they were able to get mobile home insurance which was cheaper than tiny house insurance.

Their covered porch almost doubles their living space and was built using glass from secondhand sliding doors, and driftwood posts from a nearby beach.  The deck itself is built in sections so that it can be taken apart and moved if they have to find a new location.

Finding parking for the tiny house was challenging and the couple is currently at their third location.  The first was an old covered mill where they began their build, but were evicted along with the other folks on the land.  The second was a nice forested site but it did not have any services so it was only used to complete their build.  Their third parking spot was found by putting up posters in the neighbourhoods where they wanted to live.  It has water, electricity, and septic, and they only had to bring in their own internet.  

The land rent is more affordable than renting an apartment or home in their area, and they also contribute to the landlords in other ways like chopping their firewood.

Invasion follows an alien invasion through different perspectives around the world.  In season three, those perspectives collide for the first time, as the series‚Äô main characters are brought together to work as a team on a critical mission to infiltrate the alien mothership. The ultimate apex aliens have finally emerged, rapidly spreading their deadly tendrils across our planet. It will take all our heroes working together, using all their experience and expertise, to save our species. New relationships are formed, old relationship are challenged and even shattered, as our international cast of characters must become a team before it‚Äôs too late. 

The third season of Invasion stars returning cast members Golshifteh Farahani, Shioli Kutsuna, Shamier Anderson, India Brown, Shane Zaza, Enver Gjokaj, and introduces new series regular Erika Alexander.

Invasion is created by Kinberg and Weil, who also serve as executive producers alongside Audrey Chon, David Witz, Alik Sakharov, Dan Dietz, Katie O‚ÄôConnell Marsh and Nick Nantell.

<div id="summary-271" class="summary" style="display: none;">Brits are already getting around Discord‚Äôs age verification using Death Stranding‚Äôs photo mode. We tested it. It works.

This video walks through reports from PC Gamer, protests using mock IDs of UK MPs, and a public demo on X by security consultant Paul Moore that used an image of Technology Secretary Peter Kyle to beat an age-verification tool. We also cover the legal warning from CyberNews about identity theft and why criticism of the UK‚Äôs Online Safety Act is growing. Finally, we look at the surge of VPN apps in the UK App Store.

This video is for reporting and education. Do not use fake IDs. That can be identity theft.

08:15 Chapter 3: Why Boomers Are Not Ready For Retirement
13:12 Chapter 4: The Real Cost of Forced Retirement
17:06 Chapter 5: What We Should Learn from This


Millions of Baby Boomers are quietly being forced into retirement‚Äîand it‚Äôs not the peaceful, planned transition they hoped for. In this video, we dive deep into the forced retirement crisis facing Boomers today. From age discrimination, AI replacing jobs, and the brutal realities of living on Social Security, this video uncovers why so many Boomers are not financially prepared to retire.

We‚Äôll explore why Boomers are being pushed out of the workforce, why many have little to no retirement savings, how the Great Recession impacted Late Boomers, and how a lack of financial literacy left an entire generation vulnerable.

If you‚Äôre in your 20s, 30s, or 40s‚Äîthis is your warning. Forced retirement isn‚Äôt just a Boomer problem. It‚Äôs a generational reality that you might face someday. Learn how to prepare your finances, build retirement savings early, and avoid relying on Social Security or the system to save you.

<div id="summary-291" class="summary" style="display: none;">Nathy Peluso brought the fire to the streets of New York in one of the most electric episodes we‚Äôve filmed. From reggaeton to salsa to soul, she showed off her incredible range‚Äîcalling Missy Elliott and Erykah Badu her queens and tying a Frankie Ruiz classic to her own music. Between learning English through Frank Sinatra, shouting out her friend J Balvin, and hyping up the Madrid music scene, Nathy had us laughing, singing, and even dancing salsa. You don‚Äôt want to miss this one.

RITMO (Bad Boys for Life) - J Balvin, Black Eyed Peas
DESPECH√Å - ROSAL√çA

Let's meet our hosts!
- Jake Baldino (aka the Before You Buy Guy) is pretty much the most watched reviewer on YouTube across both Gameranx and his personal channel (https://www.youtube.com/c/JakeBaldino). If you're obsessed with Delorians, The Mummy and Pizza you can discuss that stuff with him directly over on Twitter:  @JakeBaldino

- Lucy James is a Senior Producer at Gamespot. She's actually, like, experienced and credentialed and has real life skills and stuff, while the rest of the gang would be funemployed if the YT algorithm didn't kiss them for random, inexplicable reasons. 

- Skill Up used to work at McDonalds but he got fired for skimming too many chicken nuggets. He says he regrets it since he hasn't had a better job since.</div>

<div id="summary-297" class="summary" style="display: none;">The Nothing Headphone (1) might be my favourite set of over-ear headphones right now.
ALL MY FAVORITE GEAR IS LISTED BELOW üëá


I've been testing the Nothing Headphone (1) for a week now, and these transparent headphones are definitely unique. At $299, they pack premium features like 80-hour battery life, KEF-tuned drivers, and even ChatGPT integration. The build quality feels solid with aluminum construction, and the sound is surprisingly good for the price point. But there are some trade-offs you should know about before buying. I'll break down the real-world performance, comfort during long sessions, and whether these transparent headphones are worth choosing over more traditional options.

<div id="summary-304" class="summary" style="display: none;">BEFORE STARTING (Please read)Some of the information on here may be incorrect or heavily dependent on specific situations and use cases. If you find anything that you think is useful to this guide, comment down below your suggestions and I will add it to this guide.But if you find anything in here that is incorrect, misleading or that does not work and etc, please comment down below so that I can further improve this guide.Please, help contribute to this guide if possible.Understanding some conceptsBefore starting, it is important that you understand some simple concepts for better understanding of your system, so that you can debug and figure out what you need and don't need to do.Desktop environment (DE):"A desktop environment (DE) is an implementation of the desktop metaphor made of a bundle of programs, which share a common graphical user interface (GUI)".Examples:KDE Plasma, XFCE, Hyprland, GNOME, Cinnamon and etc.Compositors: "A compositor is a software which interacts with the window system as well as graphics in Linux to produce: Transparency in windows, Transition animations, Drop shadows around windows which give them a 3D effect, V sync: Waits for the display to update before updating the display".Present modes:The presentation mode specifies when a frame is presented to the window. Can be discovered which one a game is using utilizing Mangohud, but, don't rely on it as it does not show precisely which presentation mode is being used a lot of the time. And also a common bug is that Mangohud does not update this field dynamically when gaming. So in some cases (like mine on THE FINALS) Mangohud will show FIFO but the game is actually running with Mailbox.Example:FIFO (V-Sync, FPS is locked to the monitor refresh rate), Mailbox (V-Sync but frame rate is not locked) and Immediate (No V-Sync, frame rate is not locked).Wayland:"communication protocol that specifies the communication between a display server and its clients, as well as a C library implementation of that protocol.[9] A display server using the Wayland protocol is called a Wayland compositor, because it additionally performs the task of a compositing window manager".X/X11/X Window system:"The X Window System (X11, or simply X) is a windowing system for bitmap displays, common on Unix-like operating systems. X is an architecture-independent system for remote graphical user interfaces and input device capabilities. Each person using a networked terminal has the ability to interact with the display with any type of user input device".DistrosA very common topic is which distro is better for X thing? In this case which distro is the best for gaming. Although there are some distros out there like Bazzite and NobaraOS, the most popular as of now is CachyOS (which is not a gaming focused distro but it's the best in terms of gaming performance). But, you first need to understand that distros focused on gamingwill notoutperform in FPS a common distro such as Endeavour, Arch, Manjaro and etc by alargemargin. Distros such as CachyOS, Bazzite and NobaraOS do get better performance in most cases (+2 to 5%), and specially better 1% lows.However, these gaming focused distros are not focused/optimized on other type of workloads. So if you are just a regular user that also does gaming, going for something like EndeavourOS myself is a good choice as the difference is not that noticeable.It's not that CachyOS, Bazzite or NobaraOS will let you down if try to do something else. It's just that the focus a distro has generally helps with a "out-of-the-box" experience. Setting up EndeavourOS for gaming is more tedious than Bazzite or NobaraOS for example.Video driversThe most important part in all this guide is this. Using the correct driver and DE/Compositor combo is important because if you are using a NVIDIA card, then using X11 will deliver better performance and lower latency.Since this a very extensive topic, I'll just link below some useful links for you to get started/inform yourself.[Linux Graphics Drivers explained: AMD, NVIDIA, INTEL, Open Source and Proprietary]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW1CLcT83as&t=109s&pp=ygURbGludXggYW1kIGRyaXZlcnPSBwkJxwkBhyohjO8%3D[NVIDIA GPUs on Linux: What You Need to Know (Open vs closed drivers, module, GSP firmware, etc...)]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XMoADlten8&pp=ygUebnZpZGlhIGdwdSBkcml2ZXJzIGxpbnV4IGd1aWRlGuide to installing AMD/NVIDIA drivers:https://github.com/lutris/docs/blob/master/InstallingDrivers.mdStarting with the tweaks1. Disable your DE composition.Disabling composition can increase your FPS and lower latency, specially if you are in a NVIDIA card.To bring more clarification, literally disabling your DE compositor is not possible because the compositor is what draws the picture in your screen. But, on display servers like X11, composition can be "disabled". That means that with composition "disabled" X11 will run in a bare-bones state, having lower latency.Is not possible if:You are Wayland.Is not necessary if:You have a AMD card.2. Use Gamescope."Gamescope is a micro-compositor from Valve that is used on the Steam Deck. Its goal is to provide an isolated compositor that is tailored towards gaming and supports many gaming-centric features such as:Spoofing resolutions.Up-scaling using AMD FidelityFX‚Ñ¢ Super Resolution or NVIDIA Image Scaling.Limiting frame rates.As a micro-compositor it is designed to run as a nested session on top of your existing desktop environment though it is also possible to use it as an embedded compositor as well".How to use it?Set as launch options:gamescope(before %command% if you are on Steam)Arguments:-fForces exclusive full-screen.-w -hSets the window width (-w) and window height (-h)-rThe refresh rate--force-grab-cursor"Creates" a new cursor inside the window that stays locked inside the window unless Alt+Tab. Can decrease latency.--immediate-flipsForces the application to enable screen tearing.Usage example:gamescope -f -w 1920 -h 1080 -r 180 --force-grab-cursor --immediate-flips -- %command%(must include the--before %command%).3. Enable VRR (Variable Refresh Rate/Free-sync). Preferably, set it to "Automatic".4. DE/Window manager specific:KDE:Enable the "Allow tearing on full-screen applications" options in the display configuration;KDE:UseKWIN_DRM_NO_AMS=1environment variable;Sway:Useallow_tearing yeswithWLR_DRM_NO_MODIFIERS=1andWLR_DRM_NO_ATOMIC=1(Warning! NO_MODIFIERS and NO_ATOMIC can cause your PC to boot into a black screen if you have a NVIDIA card. And as reported by a user, these options can make your system slower. So do your own testing.);Hyprland:UseDirect_Scanout=1.5. Set power mode to performance (Can be done both for the CPU and GPU with CoreCtrl).6. Environment variables:MESA_VK_WSI_PRESENT_MODE=immediateReduces latency;Forces Mesa‚Äôs Vulkan WSI to use VK_PRESENT_MODE_IMMEDIATE regardless of application preference.KWIN_DRM_NO_AMS=1Reduces latency;Disables Kernel-mode ‚Äúadaptive modeset‚Äù (AMS) scheduling in KWin/DRM Wayland backend. AMS might delay cursor updates and composite operations under GPU load.PROTON_USE_NTSYNC=1Can reduce latency (it did for me on THE FINALS);Enables native NTSync support in ProtonGE (Version 10-9, 10-10 enables it by default) synchronizes Vulkan & OpenGL submissions using Linux ntsync kernel module rather than Wine‚Äôs own fsync/esync.PROTON_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1Can reduce latency and improves performance if you are on Wayland;Tells Proton to use the native winewayland.drv backend instead of XWayland/X11 so games run as pure Wayland clients.SDL_VIDEODRIVER=waylandCan reduce latency and improves performance if you are on Wayland;Forces SDL2 apps to use Wayland back-end instead of defaulting to X11/XWayland. Without it, SDL2 usually uses X11 even under Wayland unless compiled otherwise.7. Use a different kernel.If you are on a gaming focused distro then this is not necessary because those distros already have a custom modified kernel made specifically for gaming. But, if you are not using a gaming focused distro, then this is could prove to be helpful. As it can increase gaming performance and lower latency (measured by an average of 2ms). Such as my case that improved stability. But, do be aware that those kernels have custom schedulers and they can have other issues. So, do your testing to see if it fits you.The most common kernel for this use case is Linux-Zen, which is the one I'm using right now. It solved a problem I've been dealing with Arch that in certain cases, most primarily gaming, OS freezes can happen, making the whole OS become unresponsive and freeze under heavy workloads. In BeamNG I had a problem where the game would freeze with the OS for about a couple of minutes every time something new had to load. This went away when I used Linux-Zen, which decreases latency by an average of 2ms.8. Use a different DE.Desktop environments such as KDE have the highest latency. If you want a light-weight DE or just one that has lower input latency, use Hyprland or XFCE.A recent testing has been done regarding this topic:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UG8WeX_h1VGytK1Tz-56gETmzsM2CPiwXS9BoZ-1F60/edit?gid=0#gid=0(It's a more recent up to date version from this post made by the same person:https://www.reddit.com/r/linux\_gaming/comments/1mejrig/linuxwayland\_vs\_win11\_click\_to\_photon\_latency/)9. Use LatencyFleX to use NVIDIA Reflex and AMD Anti Lag."Vendor agnostic latency reduction middle-ware. An alternative to NVIDIA Reflex". LatencyFleX is a tool that can be used to enable the Reflex feature on NVIDIA and Anti Lag on AMD cards.THIS IS A USE AT YOUR OWN RISK TOOL, THIS CAN RESULT IN A GAME BAN ON GAMES SUCH AS CS2/THE FINALS/OVERWATCH ETC... (Although some players have reported not getting banned using this, still, be careful when using it).LatencyFleX GitHub:https://github.com/ishitatsuyuki/LatencyFleXVideo that explains in more depth and also includes a tutorial:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvmkSftYyP8&t=188s&pp=ygUSbGludXggbGF0ZW5jeSBmbGV410. General knowledge, common occurrences and possible fixes/causes.Higher frames reduces tearing and latency, making the experience more smooth and responsive (Higher frames with no V-Sync feels more responsive than higher frames with V-Sync).High GPU usage can cause more input latency. So playing at 99% GPU usage at 220 FPS has more latency than 90% GPU usage at 200 FPS for example (If you use Reflex or Anti Lag then this is not a issue).Input lag,can be caused by:Your compositor forces V-Sync;V-Sync turned on in-game;Game/Proton/Wine incompatibility;Border-less or windowed mode have higher latency than exclusive full-screen (This is not true on Wayland as far knowledge goes, but setting a game to full-screen will enable the "Allow tearing on full-screen applications" on KDE to take effect).;Check if your compositor is compositing in general or if only is compositing in full-screen applications.Useful for solving this problem:Environment variables;Disabling V-Sync;"Allow tearing on full-screen applications" should be enabled on KDE;Gamescope with forced full-screen (-f and --immediate-flips);Use NTSYNC with ProtonGE;Force your compositor to not use V-Sync (if possible);VRR (Variable refresh rate/Free-sync) enabled;Use X11 instead of Wayland, specially on NVIDIA.---Stutters,can be caused by (assuming your hardware is not the problem):Shader compilation;Game incompatibility with Linux;Proton version.Useful for solving this problem:Try dxvk-gplasync:https://gitlab.com/Ph42oN/dxvk-gplasync;Use Gamemode;Disable overlays (Generally do not have any impact, so test it out to se if it helps);Set your power profile to performance (CoreCtrl can be used for this);Different kernel;Older or wrong drivers, specially video drivers if this issue is global.?.(Not related to latency but useful):Disable mouse acceleration.Use Feral Gamemode.(Some of the texts and sources used for this guide are directly from sites, videos and wikis, but I can not link them here due to Reddit spam filters)submitted by/u/SadBrazilian7[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-305" class="summary" style="display: none;">Elgato sent me the camera to review but I was not told what to say or paid for the review. To be honest, I like the webcam a lot. I think that the colors are more accurate in the Elgato Facecam 4k. 

The biggest perk about the Elgato 4k webcam are: 
- It shoots in 4k 60fps 
- You can add camera filters
- You can have Custom LUTs (custom settings)
- AI Backgrounds

Elgato products do cost a bit of a premium but they are also a premium product. If you want to pick up an elgato 4k webcam, use my amazon affiliate link here:

<div id="summary-306" class="summary" style="display: none;">Morning folks,I've been using Bazzite for a few weeks now, quite happy with the general user experience. I've noticed however that there are a lot of things which I want to do as a developer that are major friction points. Today's the latest example: I want to install aG13 driverso I can use my keypad when playing games, and the process is a series of reboots to install libraries through rpm-ostree. I need libusb1-devel and java-latest-openjdk.x86_64 (one reboot). Next I need the gtk library (second reboot, which I don't want to do yet). As a programmer, I've noticed a few other libraries I've wanted are missing now and then, and I've just given up on doing work on this computer and working on a more permissive VM instead.Am I missing something? Is the intention to just build everything from source now if I'm doing development and ignore the conveniences of installing precompiled libraries? Or am I really supposed to reboot my computer half a dozen to a dozen times to install a chain of libraries as I encounter the next layer of missing libraries?Addendum: Lots of solid opinions and feedback. In particular the vibe I was getting from distrobox is "it's Podman masquerading as WSL", but I can see it's not quite that simple. I was able to make the driver compile in a distrobox and it functions outside of it as a user space program, so good to know on that front. I'm not familiar with packaging things for homebrew so I guess I have a new thing to look into.submitted by/u/Feynt[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-309" class="summary" style="display: none;">I made an autounattend.xml file for our virtual machines (I have others, like for basic data entry type users, low hardware, etc.) basically stripping down all junk (it's for a VM for crying out loud!!) becase apparently some users always get a BSOD when running some VPN software and legacy apps on their computers but works just fine on VMs.Anyways, after a fatal error with their VM I decided to delete it altogether and test my freshly made autounattend.xml file with thehttps://schneegans.de/windows/unattend-generator/page. Everything worked but upon reboot I let it Windows Update do its business because I didn't want the user to have to wait ages for backlog pending updates. First reboot after applying updates and all the junk was there, apps such as Spotify (IT'S A VM!!!), Microsoft Solitaire, Climpchamp and whatnot. Oh and Skype, which is already EOL. The VM is supposed to run government legacy apps only, not even Office, Chrome or multimedia codecs are necessary, only a shared folder with the host to export generated CSV and other files.What the heck Microsoft?submitted by/u/NETkoholik[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-314" class="summary" style="display: none;">So I have inly encountered this with Arma 3 so far.Booting the game is fine and it actually runs great compared to Windows. But the problem comes if I alt-tab, which I need to do in order to set up stuff like Discord streaming or Teamspeak for radio mods.The first time it's fine, but after the 2nd or so it really breaks everything. Plasma just dies and I am left with a black screen even after I exit the game. Plasma gives me this weird readback if I try to fiddle with it.The only way I have found to fix it was to open the Plasma Renderer using the Terminal and "kcmshell6 kcm_qtquicksettings" and setting thr 'Rendering Backend' to 'Automatic'.The only problem is that when I play Arma again, the same thing happens. I look at the Rendering Backend again and somehow it's set to 'Software'. And it just breaks until I set it back to AutomaticWhat's a permanent Fix? How can I prevent this from happening?submitted by/u/Blockhead_Gundam[link][comments]</div>

I don't want that in the slightest. It's not difficult to log into separate tools. If I want them to integrate/trigger each other, that's what API's are for!Every vendor out there is flabbergasted when I tell them a 'single pane of glass' platform is a negative mark for us.Am I the problem? Am I taking crazy pills?EDIT:So I'm seeing a mixed bag on the responses. Everything from "teams are too dumb/busy/segregated to tie tools together so single pane is great" to "it's so they can sell you multiple subs" to my fave, "it's all marketting".At least I'm not crazy.submitted by/u/nerdyviking88[link][comments]</div>

‚ÄúFoundation‚Äù has captivated audiences with its intricate world-building, stunning visuals, bold storytelling, and compelling performances. Season 3 continues the epic chronicle of a band of exiles on their monumental journey to save humanity and rebuild civilization amid the fall of the Galactic Empire. 

Set 152 years after the events of Season 2, the Foundation has become increasingly established far beyond its humble beginnings while the Cleonic Dynasty‚Äôs Empire has dwindled. As both of these galactic powers forge an uneasy alliance, a threat to the entire galaxy appears in the fearsome form of a warlord known as ‚ÄúThe Mule‚Äù whose sights are set on ruling the universe by use of physical and military force, as well as mind control. It‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess who will win, who will lose, who will live, and who will die as Hari Seldon, Gaal Dornick, the Cleons, and Demerzel play a potentially deadly game of intergalactic chess.

<div id="summary-329" class="summary" style="display: none;">In the last couple of weeks i've been questioning myself about privacy, data, owning our things etc etc. I started doing a personal media server, and in the meantime i was thinking about the "gaming" side of things. After the big Microsoft layoffs my (already precarious) trust in the commonsense of the company is finally vanished. I have an Xbox Series S, but no desire to pay GamePass anymore, i have Windows 10 on my main rig (and 11 on my hp laptop) but even less desire to keep paying money to Microsoft for a lot of reason,So i searched and found Bazzite. In the back of my mind i have this question: with my rig, it will be worth to switch?CPU: Ryzen 2600xGPU: RX6600 Palit 8GBRam: 16gb DDR4 2600MHZSSD M.2 256gbTwo Caviar Blue 7200RPM 1TB Each.I play a lot of games, mainly single player, but sometimes (just sometimes) i play multiplayer games like Battlefield 1, older CoD, i want to buy Dune Awekening to play it with my best friend.Also i play a lot of older games. How is the compatibility side of bazzite? I can stay mostly safe? i have some experience with linux (ubuntu/Debian) and i probably used a lot of time fixing things on windows. I also use my pc for discord, browsing web. Should i switch?submitted by/u/MastropezzoOG[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-330" class="summary" style="display: none;">This isn‚Äôt your typical tech news roundup. In this video, we break down four massive stories from July that signal a major shift in how AI will shape our lives...from what we wear, to how we work, to the policies that govern it.

Here‚Äôs what happened:

üï∂Ô∏è Meta‚Äôs Superintelligence Lab
Mark Zuckerberg just announced a $110 billion push to bring AI into your everyday life. Starting with smart glasses that act like a personal assistant. With talent from OpenAI and Scale AI leading the charge, Meta is going all-in on AI.

üá∫üá∏ The U.S Government's ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs AI Action Plan‚Äù
The U.S. government released its most aggressive national AI strategy yet... focusing on speed, infrastructure, and ideology. From banning ‚Äúwoke AI‚Äù in federal use to prioritizing open-source models and deregulated development, this could shape AI‚Äôs trajectory for years.

ü§ñ ChatGPT Gets Agency
OpenAI gave ChatGPT the ability to take real-world actions: browse the web, send emails, even run code. This moves us into the era of agentic AI where AI doesn‚Äôt just answer your questions, it takes initiative.

üöó Tesla‚Äôs $16.5B Chip Deal with Samsung
Tesla signed a multi-billion dollar deal to manufacture custom AI chips with Samsung in Texas. These chips will power everything from Full Self-Driving to the Optimus robot, making Tesla not just a car company, but a full-stack AI player.</div>

<div id="summary-333" class="summary" style="display: none;">I have to say, it is really not funny in real life. Like holy F@#$2...He is a micromanager who is not a manager.he has the type of mindset that if you don't do it his way, you are doing it wrong.you could do 95% of the work, and he will come over adjust some cables, adjust a some monitors, take a picture of the setup, and in his head he basically did the work (even tho no one ask him to do so)Brother would start to update random confluence pages on Saturday and Sunday.he would be creeping on everyone's ticket in the ticket queue.He assigns tickets to you without asking or telling you if you have the time.He is the type of person that if you were to make a mistake, even tho you fixed it before it affected any users, he would tell the manager in order to get good boy points.Mind you, it is not like this guy is some IT god that would solve any issues or would get to the solution that no one could think of. His IT knowledge is on par with the rest of the team.Our manager is chill in the sense that as long as you do your tickets and work on your project, he is not on top of you, but on the other hand, this guy always tries to pseudo-manage people.I already confirmed this is not a me thing, and the other guys think the same thing.I'm not a confrontational type of person, but this guy is getting to me; I'm about to start shit. I just want to rant a bit because it is starting to frustrate me.Update: I forgot to add, based on his personality, I'm 100% sure that he is aiming to be the next in line for the manager position, so my fear is that anything I say or do could come back to bite me.submitted by/u/shiraco415[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-335" class="summary" style="display: none;">alright 2 things: 

1) the way a couple decides to split is ultimately up to them but i will say‚Ä¶. equity over equality‚Ä¶

if younger me (college student dating someone working full time) came up to me for advice i would tell her to absolutely tf NOT offer to split every single expense in the relationship

2) I think it‚Äôs ok to not offer to split on a first date. I obviously am always grateful and say ty!! if we end up getting dessert, i would be more than happy to grab that but no more performative purse searching and wallet grabbing!!!!

From the psychedelic swirl of the 60s to the slow, bass-heavy haze of modern hip hop, cannabis has quietly shaped the sonic landscape for over half a century. But how exactly does a plant influence production choices, vocal styles, even the tempo of entire genres?
This is the story of how weed became an invisible co-producer‚Äîfrom The Beatles to Snoop Dogg, from rock to trap‚Äîand how you can still hear its fingerprints in the music of today. It‚Äôs about altered states, slowed-down beats, and what creativity sounds like when your mind is somewhere else entirely.

<div id="summary-340" class="summary" style="display: none;">I played Battlefield 6 for 4 hours, and I‚Äôm honestly shocked by how good it is. Huge maps, tight gunplay, true squad coordination this feels like the Battlefield we've been waiting for. In this preview, I break down the gameplay, destruction, vehicles, and why I think this could finally be the comeback DICE needs.

EA invited me to join the event and covered my Uber to and from the Venue. I also ate a bunch of chips.

The Presidential Fitness Test for American schoolchildren was created back in 1966, and required kids to do sit-ups, push-ups, pull-ups and the one-mile run as part of a test in school gym classes.

The program changed during the Obama administration to focus more on individual health, but President Trump says it's time to bring it back.</div>

<div id="summary-355" class="summary" style="display: none;">Please, please, ignore the fact we're still running Access 97 for now please. I need a better way of getting this bullshit deployed silently.. Right now I have just about everything automated but this stupid thing I can't figure out. Takes a decent amount of time to get it to actually work on Windows 11.Finding documentation from before 2005 is a nightmare. I try to install "Microsoft Network Installation Wizard 2.1" and it just refuses to read any .LST or .STF files I throw at it saying its not from a "post-admin network image". What does that even mean?We're a small company and our dev team sucks. Our 15+ year DBA refuses to touch his precious ancient SQL servers to update the database to something more sane. No one else can do his job so here I am with this shit.6 years ago we hired a new CTO who blew millions of dollars on a rebuild of the entire application in Azure. It failed spectacularly, never worked at all, and now the whole company is scrambling to make sales and polish up this old turd of an application that runs on old SQL code and has our internal users still interacting with it on Access 97.[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-356" class="summary" style="display: none;">This is happening right now with Battlefield 6 posts but affects other super popular games like Fortnite, Roblox, League of Legends, EA Sports FC, GTA Online, Call of Duty, Destiny, PUBG, R6 Siege and more.Not everything is for you. We get it. You don't need to spell it out every time.But these are super popular games that most of us want to be able to play. By publicly expressing negative interest for such games on Linux you are harming us. If I was a market researcher scoping for Battlefield brand sentiment online, the message from the Linux gamers would be clear to me.Personally I am against invasive kernel space anti cheat solutions. Ideally I would like to see these games available on Linux without introducing such shitty measures into kernel.But most of us don't care about technicalities and just want to play the super popular game.submitted by/u/hardpenguin[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-379" class="summary" style="display: none;">Well everyone, I've been away for much longer than I expected, but I‚Äôm now writing this while admiring how smooth and responsive this distro is. I had an intense day with it yesterday auto-mounting, reformatting Ntfs drives to Btrfs, suspicious cloned drives, but all of it has helped me step out of my comfort zone. I briefly considered switching back to Windows, but that thought disappeared when I researched other distros. I'm grateful I chose Bazzite instead of Mint or Pop because I prioritize gaming above all else, and those other options couldn't support me as well as this one has.I'm learning basic stuff like mentioned above, getting used and learning each day and after solving it gets to a satisfying level. I wanna thank everyone in the discord who helped me and the people from my first post who pushed me further to hug the penguin, right now I'm learning ujust terminal commands and bookmarked some tutorials because one day I might start to use the terminal more but time we'll see.Just today I've found alternatives for WinRAR or Office, and PeaZip with LibreOffice will do the work just fine. And thank god I didn't have a damn adobe subscription because Davinci is dope.submitted by/u/MysticalPeace[link][comments]</div>

Street of Dreams is an unfinished documentary film about the musician Tiny Tim and the 1979 Ghost Train fire at Luna Park Sydney, directed and produced by Australian artist Martin Sharp. The film first features Tiny Tim, showcasing footage of his record-setting, two-hour-and-seventeen-minute professional singing marathon at Luna Park Sydney in January 1979. It tells Tiny's life story, framed around the marathon performance footage, while highlighting his many eccentricities, religious convictions and others hangups as captured by Sharp's camera crews in both Australia and the United States.</div>

<p class="feed-title">Living Big In A Tiny House</p>
<button class="toggle-summary-btn" data-target="summary-381">...</button>
<div id="summary-381" class="summary" style="display: none;">Step inside this absolutely breathtaking modern tiny home set deep in the heart of the Australian rainforest. Here amongst the towering trees, tiny house magic has been created!  Built by superyacht captain Johny, this stunning rainforest tiny house is a personal paradise, designed as the ultimate retreat from the world. When he's not sailing the globe with the rich and famous, Johny returns to this peaceful sanctuary to surf, recharge, and reconnect with nature.

The home itself is a masterclass in tiny house design. With a single-level layout and a focus on openness and flow, it makes the most of its lush surroundings. Massive picture windows bring the forest inside, creating a seamless connection to the outdoors. The home feels expansive, calm, and deeply rooted in its environment.

Outside, the landscaping is equally as impressive. A generous deck expands the living area into the forest, while natural elements like boulders and large timber logs have been thoughtfully placed to ground the home in the landscape. It‚Äôs the perfect blend of modern design and raw, untamed nature.

This is a tiny home that you won't want to miss. We absolutely loved getting to visit this rainforest retreat and share Johny‚Äôs incredible story with you. We hope you enjoy the tour as much as we did.

<div id="summary-383" class="summary" style="display: none;">Nintendo is joining the crows and raising prices on old hardware. The base Switch is now estimated to cost $299 without a bundled game, and prices are going up across the board on older models and accessories. This comes after similar moves by Xbox and PlayStation in other territories but now we can add Nintendo‚Äôs case to the list :/

But you must not believe her. Maxwell was the right-hand woman of Jeffrey Epstein to whom she was a girlfriend as well as a top manager of Epstein\u2019s clandestine trafficking operation.\n\nNow Maxwell is begging the Supreme Court, the Congress as well as the President of the United States to get her conviction overturned, get clemency or an outright pardon. \n\nThis would be a disastrous blow to the criminal justice system as well as a major disservice to the dozens of victims Maxwell was found guilty of abusing along with Epstein. \n\nBut the worst part of this is that some conservative commentators are now claiming that Maxwell might be trusted to tell the truth and they are regurgitating her new line of defense \u2013 that she wasn\u2019t a co-conspirator in Epstein\u2019s criminal enterprise \u2013 but that she was his victim.

We talk about the lost joy of doing one thing at a time, the value of being bored, and how simple habits\u2014like listening to an album start to finish or playing a game without a second screen\u2014can help restore our attention span. We also get into the comeback of physical media, why buying CDs and ripping DVDs has become unexpectedly satisfying, and how infinite streaming choice might be making us less happy. Later in the episode, we talk Halo 3 playlist design, why modern FPS games miss the mark on fun, and a productivity warning signal to watch out for.

    "summary": "Tucked into a steep hillside in Los Angeles, the Kallis Residence is a striking example of Schindler\u2019s mastery of site-sensitive design. Created in 1946 for artist and film art director Mischa Kallis, the home embraces the contours of the slope with a dynamic composition of overlapping volumes and carefully placed terraces. After purchasing the home in 2017, homeowners John Gillespie and Susan Orlean embarked on a meticulous, multi-year restoration. Having previously lived in another Schindler-designed residence nearby, they understood the potential hidden beneath years of wear and neglect\u2014and were committed to bringing the home back to its original brilliance. \n\nOriginally conceived as two distinct structures\u2014a modest one-bedroom residence and a separate two-bedroom studio\u2014the design cleverly linked these spaces via an outdoor terrace that was later enclosed, creating a more cohesive interior environment.Schindler\u2019s signature architectural language\u2014bold geometric forms, extensive glazing, and built-in furnishings\u2014gives the house its sculptural and expressive quality. One of its most distinctive features is a vertical wood-slat screen that runs along the downslope fa\u00e7ade, simultaneously acting as a privacy element and a subtle way to integrate the home into the natural landscape. \n\nIn the 1960s, the home was acquired by members of Kallis\u2019s extended family, William and Jacqueline Sharlin. Working with architect Josef Van der Kar, a colleague of Schindler\u2019s, they updated and unified the residence, blending the original two wings into a more fluid living space. Recognized as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument, the Kallis-Sharlin Residence is a powerful reminder of Schindler\u2019s legacy. It reflects his deep commitment to designing for both the landscape and the individual\u2014a philosophy that helped shape the Southern California modernist movement.\n\nFilm - Mick Aure @miccck \nProducer - Elias Tebache @socalarchitecture \nMusic - Deep Al Brindle @DeepAlBrindle\nPhotography - @OpenSpaceSeries\n\nSpecial Thanks to John Gillespie & Susan Orlean \n@susanorlean @john.gillespie.142 \n\n\nDo you have a home that you believe could fit in our series?

And my guess is that even if you don't know the Belgian duo Soulwax (AKA 2Manydjs) by name, you'll know their biggest hits, like early 2000s indie electronic anthems \"E Talking\" or \"NY Excuse.\"\n\nIn this interview with Resident Advisor editor Gabriel Szatan, the brothers David and Stephen Dewaele talk about their decades-long career and writing their first album in more than seven years, All Systems Are Lying, which they road tested for ages before deciding to put it out. They also unpack bigger thematic arcs in their work and lives: the abiding influence of New Order's Power, Corruption and Lies LP; their creative philosophy (\"If it sounds too simple, leave it alone);\" and the nature of musical trends and revivals, which have fluctuated intensely since they began performing and releasing records.

When I say things I mean such various things we simply had no idea what was going on. Randomly, parts of completely unrelated systems started crashing. For example a geographic piece of software we run maps on and a storage replica that have nothing to do with each other. This spanned literally anything that has an relation to Windows.Around the same time we started noticing Workstation service is crashing on some of the affected clients and services, but this was pretty rare so we never gave it too much thought even though I literally never saw this service crash in my 10 years here.Now lets go back about a year ago, back then I noticed some servers and clients are failing to update their group policy. A quick google landed me in C:\\Windows\\System32\\GroupPolicy. Delete the contents and the issue goes away. I proceeded to create a SCCM baseline which finds the failed GPUpdate event, and if that happens it just deletes the content of said folder and runs gpupdate /force. This fixed around 95% of the problems. Rarely this didn't manage to fix the issue, at which point we usually fixed manually. My boss decided this is no good and 2 months ago asked our junior SCCM guy to come up with a better solution.You can see where this is going. Junior went to some AI which spat out 2 pieces of PowerShell code, junior applied code in the scripts of said SCCM baseline and went home happy. The code.... It changed the event that decides when to run the remediation script to any event concerning an issue with gpupdate, including warnings, and in the remediation script, on top of a mountain of unneeded BS it contained the following 2 lines:Restart-Service Netlogon -ForceRestart-Service Workstation -ForceThere are a lot of other services that depend on these 2 services and they also depend on each other, and of course things just started falling apart. I can't tell you how many hours of debugging went into this. Global support teams we alerted, product groups running insane debugging tools, we canceled storage replicas, clusters, reinstalled whole RDS farms etc etc etc.6 weeks later I caught a service failing as I was there with procmon running, and saw the script it was running and the folder the script came from. I managed to work my way from there to the baseline.The junior was not fired, even though if he only asked any one of us we would never allow such a script to run.Oh and did I mention, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T BLINDLY TRUST AI ANSWERS.submitted by/u/StrikerXTZ[link][comments]",

It has so many limitations, bugs and simply just broken in some cases. I have a M4 MacBook Air as well and it's a decent experience but I'm not an Apple person so part of the Apple experience is irrelevant to me.I had a few primary blockers for me in terms of switching to Linux. Linux being Linux wasn't one because I've been using WSL2 Ubuntu distro for quite a while and I've played around with a few Debian based distros on and off (although 80% of my experience is with Ubuntu). I am ok with the terminal and occasional time consuming troubleshoots.My main blockers were:Can I bring all my Dev tools exactly as is to Linux?Can I get Claude Desktop working with MCP support on Linux (because there's no official package)?Can I use Adobe Illustrator on Linux?Can I play World of Warcraft on Linux?Can I use Office 365 on Linux?Can I have a decent multimedia experience without any annoying driver issues, codec issues or just simply broken media experience?Enter Bazzite! A comprehensive solution for my issues.My desktop specs:Ryzen 3700x32GB RAMRTX 3060 12GB GPUMSI MAG B550 Mortar mainboard with WiFi and BluetoothI went with theBazzite Nvidia KDE Desktopedition and then revised it to theBazzite DX Nvidia KDEedition. (Never rebase cross desktop environments i.e.: KDE and GNOME, is what experts say so sure, I'd say the same thing. Anyway, why would you want to ruin your clean distro installation in the first place?)1. Dev Tools and the Dev environmentWith Bazzite DX, VS Code, Podman and Docker comes with the base and I get homebrew built in as well with Distrobox also in the base to cover for containerisation. (Containerisation is quite important as I've learned and more about it a bit later). I've made Podman the primary engine as it doesn't have root access requirements and is generally more secure and slightly better performance too.I use Cursor most of the time and there's an Appimage route to get Cursor working on Bazzite with almost no hassle at all using Gear Lever.Terminal. Now this is a very important part of the overall Dev experience. You want to feel comfortable with your terminal and you want to feel excited to use it. I usually go with zsh as my shell and ohmyzsh for the prompt with powerlevel10k theme and catppuccin mocha colours. Since I'm changing my setup, I decided to venture out and see what other options are out there.My new terminal, is the default KDE terminal. nothing fancy there. it seems like a decent enough terminal and I'm fine with it. The shell however, I switched to Fish! Its different. There indeed is a learning curve because the bash/zsh commands that I know may not work on fish. Curl installation commands is a challenge I encountered almost immediately and I still need to learn how to use it properly. But the good news is, worst case scenario, i can always bash it (which is what i did with the curl commands but I'm sure many people here would 'educate' me on how stupid I'm being without learning how to use fish properly, and yes, I will, eventually, gradually, but the workaround, WORKS and I just want to let another newbie know that).So... FISH. Well, what can I say, I like it! Especially the functions. After setting up a few functions and using it for about an hour or so, let me tell you,I'm never going back to any other shell ever again!(jk. I have to go back to bash once in a while because I'm fish noob and don't know how to properly write the fish compatible commands yet.) But seriously, I'm all in with fish and I have only scraped the surface yet I'm already impressed by how usable and feature rich it is. Highly recommended switching to fish. (first function or abbreviation you should setup is the cd functions to your most visited folders.)Next up, is the prompt. Nothing fancy there, just Homebrew Starship and did my own custom version of the Catppuccin Powerline preset (https://starship.rs/presets/catppuccin-powerline). You can try it out from here -https://github.com/hashangit/hashangit-starship-config. It's pretty, and fairly easy to customise with so many plug-in options also available to choose from. One thing I noticed is that you can't use the [git_branch], [git_status] plug-in to conditionally switch colour based on if the branch is in sync or out of sync. I would have loved to have it change to green if in sync with origin and yellow if not but, I couldn't find a way to do it. So I'm configured it to show changes vs show nothing using the [git_status] plug-in instead for now. (any feedback is welcome!)Alright, Let's get to the fun part!ContainerisationBazzite is an immutable Linux distro (more like built on top of an immutable Fedora but same difference). This is a good thing AND at the same time, it means you need a bit of extra attention when setting everything up. OS base being immutable is great and you should try your very best to keep it that way, for security as well as to prevent YOU, YOURSELF, out of ignorance, destroying your own os installation. Latter is the more important thing for someone like myself, who doesn't really know the ins and outs but learn by fiddling around. But you can gain system level access if you want, with rpm-ostree, but, so far, i haven't had the need to. Homebrew is available and it, as far as I understand, has separation already so it shouldn't affect the base os, meaning I, and also You can't destroy your system out of ignorance.So then how do you get things done in scenarios where you need system level access? Easy.SWITCH TO UBUNTU!No what I actually meant is, get an Ubuntu based container running on Distrobox and get your development enviornment setup there with your tools and dependencies. At this point, I'm sure the experts are just screaming out of their heads, telling me how wrong my approach is, and yes, I have the IDEs etc setup on my host and I have my runtimes and dependencies and and other tools setup in the container, and I'm exporting them out to the host. Is it the best way? perhaps not. Does it work just fine for my workflows? So far YES! without a hitch. So for now, this is perfectly fine as far as I'm concerned. You could have all your different projects isolated into their own individual containers including al the tools like IDEs etc but, I thought that is too much for my specific requirement. Ionly really work with JS, TS, python for NextJS, ExpressJS, NodeJS, React/ React Native, different python projects (all isolated with venv and potery) and that's about it for now so really, my requirements aren't too complex to warrant a more complex isolation approach per project. In fact, being able to use the same pnpm store across project, helps a lot in my case as I have a metered internet connection. I can write up a guide based on how I did my setup IF enough people need me to but, to be honest, getting Claude to write a custom guide for your specific scenario would be the better approach (which is what I did. I had no clue whatsoever on what I'm suppose to do in the first place when I thought of switching to Bazzite)That brings me to the next important thing in my list.Claude Desktop2. Getting Claude Desktop with MCP support to work on BazziteTruth be told, I am no expert in this. I mean I am an expert in USING Claude but not in terms of turning an electron windows app into a Linux app. So all the credit should go to the original developer on making it a really simple painless process to get Claude Desktop working with MCP supportON UBUNTU!. Alright, I'm sure you can see where I'm going with this. Just install it into the ubuntu container and export the app out to the host just like we did with pnpm, node, etc.. it just works and the instructions are so very clear and simple.Thank YouEsmiand Thank YouAaddrickHere's the link to the repo that I used:https://github.com/emsi/claude-desktop/tree/mainHere's the link to the original repo which the above one is based on:https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian3. Adobe Illustrator on LinuxApparently, this is not possible and Adobe doesn't seem to have any real intention to bring Adobe suite to Linux, at all, ever. So that's that! Honestly, I use Illustrator quite rarely as of late in my workflows (Thank You Canva) so this is nota major blocker for me anymore. I have 3 options available. I can use Illustrator on my MacBook or, I can temporarily switch to my old Windows installation for just that or I can run Windows on a VM on Bazzite and run Illustrator on that. Honestly, using Ilustrator on my MacBook is the easiest, most painless route so yeah, I don't think I'm going to bother with 'Adobe on Linux' battle.4. World of Warcraft Retail on LinuxNow, here's the funny thing. WoW Windows game works better on Linux compared to Windows! \ud83e\udef3\ud83c\udffd\ud83c\udfa4 Setting up is quite simple. The route that worked for me out of the box with no issues, is Lutris route. Bazzite comes with Lutris pre-installed. Just search forBattle.netin Lutris and install. But first, you gotta do a couple of small things.Get ProtonPlus via BazaarOn ProtonPlus, switch to Lutris from Steam on the top left corner. Scroll down to Wine, and download 'Wine-Staging-Tkg (Kron4ek)'. Anything after v10.6 works apparently and I'm using v10.12 which works in August 2025 (before retail 11.2 patch. PTR 11.2 works so no reason why 11.2 shouldn't work).Next, on Lutris, Preferences > Runners > Wine > runner Options > Wine Version and seect the newly downloaded version. Alternatively, if you have already downloadedBattle.net, you can right click, Configure > Runner Options > Wine Version and select the latest version you just downloaded. You can double-check to see if DXVK and VKD3D are enabled because you need to have those enabled.Now you can go ahead and run Battle.net. Just make sure to read what the wizaed says and do as mentioned. You want it to download the Battle.net Update Agent then run it and go all the way until the login window is presented.DON NOT LOGIN RIGHT NOW!Let's Lutris finish the installation properly.Once Lutris completes the full installation, then you can launchBattle.netand login.Now, if you are coming from Windows, and already have your game files on Windows, and don't want to download the game files again, well, you are in luck! but, you need to first do a couple of things. You need to log into your windows installation (probably for the last time in your life) and turn off 'Fast Start Up' which you may need to do through Powershell now because the control Panel and Settings aren't showing the option anymore (at least in my case) and turn off any other settings that cause the ntfs-3g driver on Linux to prevent you from mouting the Windows installation with full read / write permissions (a simple Google search can give you all the information you need on this.). This is required if your WoW game files are saved on the same drive as your Windows installation.Now, Bazite should be able to easily mount the NTFS drive with your WoW game files and you can just do this via Dolphin (file browser) itsel. (Remember to double-check if its mounted with out and write restrictions). Now its just a matter of updating the game files folder onBattle.netclient just like you normally would on Windows and point to the game files folder on the NTFS partition. This works just fine without any issues whatsoever. But the recommended way is to copy the game files folder onto your btrfs drive for best perfomance. But, personally, I'd keep it as is, just in case, if WoW has issues on Bazzite (unlikely) for some reason (even Blizzard has confirmed that while they don't officially support Linux, they would not intentionally break it either.)Launch the game and start your adventures in Azeroth and K'aresh from where you left off! (Or in Outland. Your choice. I'm not judging.)5. Office 365 on Linux.Outright, this doesn't work. But its the same story like the Adobe Illustrator. Google workspace EXISTS! And the Office 365 broswer version is adequate in most cases. If strictly need Office 365, I can use it on my MacBook, or switch to Windows for a it temporarily. Also, from my experience, Libre Office applications are more than capable and is a decent user experience unless you strictly want the Microsoft vesion for some strange reason. So this is not and issue, at least for me.6. The multimedia experienceSimple answer is, Bazzite multimedia experience (atealst in my case) isFantastic!I tried out Ubuntu 25.04 when it came out, on my Desktop, and the audio quality was bad and it sounded tinny and no bass. On Windows, since I'm using a bluetooth speaker, there's a delay between the video and audio which completely destroys the media experience. On Bazzite though, I have no such issues. Audio is deep and rich with proper bass and while i have not yet gotten to it, there are easy to use system-wide EQ tools to tune it up to your exact preference. My Speakers have SBC codec and Bazzit is correctly picking and using the SBC codec for best possible output. I have a dual 2k + 1080p monitor setup. While they are not high refresh rate monitors, I'm not seeing anything wrong with the visual experience compared to what I see on Windows and when i connect my MacBook to the same monitors. Onething I've noticed is that the default setting is to let the monitor manage the colour accuracy so if you have 2 different monitors (especially 2 different brands and 2 different panel tech like mine with HP and Samsung) you'll see the same thing in different colours. This for me is acceptable and i think depending on your monitor's capabilities, you might be able to make them lookalike with a bit a tweaking in the display configuration.So, should you switch to Bazzite?YES. It's better than Windowssubmitted by/u/Designer_Athlete7286[link][comments]",

First it was cable, then VHS, then DVDs, streaming, and even COVID. And yet \u2014 the big screen persists.\n\nSure, the landscape has changed. Since 2019, the U.S. has lost nearly 5,000 movie theater screens. Big chains have struggled financially. Alamo Drafthouse, once independent, was recently acquired by Sony Pictures. And Netflix\u2019s Ted Sarandos famously claimed that moviegoing is an \u201coutdated concept.\u201d\n\nBut people still love going to the movies \u2014 and independent movie theater owners are meeting that passion head-on.\n\nAcross the country, independent cinemas are reimagining what it means to be a theater. From inventive programming and community events to affordable tickets and local partnerships, they\u2019re creating experiences that go far beyond just watching a film.\n\nWe sat down with Emelyn Stuart (Stuart Cinema), Matthew Viragh (Nitehawk Cinemas), and Thaddeus Bouchard (Screendollars) to explore how these theaters are thriving \u2014 and why the industry isn\u2019t on life support just yet.\n\nWatch Vox\u2019s latest to learn more.\n\nLinks:\n- http://nitehawkcinema.com/\n- https://www.stuartcinema.com/\n- https://screendollars.com/\n- https://cinemaunited.org/behind-the-screens/\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

This group will help ensure our approach reflects the latest research and best practices.On healthy useSupporting you when you\u2019re struggling.ChatGPT is trained to respond with grounded honesty. There have been instances where our 4o model fell short in recognizing signs of delusion or emotional dependency. While rare, we're continuing to improve our models and are developing tools to better detect signs of mental or emotional distress so ChatGPT can respond appropriately and point people to evidence-based resources when needed.Keeping you in control of your time.Starting today, you\u2019ll see gentle reminders during long sessions to encourage breaks.

    "summary": "Just had one of those infuriating \"WTF, Microsoft?\" moments. We run a production mail system through Azure Communication Services (ACS) Email, which, as documented (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/email/email-overview), is completely separate from Exchange Online. It\u2019s an authenticated mail service using App Registrations, no connectors, no direct send, no relation to EXO transport pipeline at all.So what happens when we (responsibly) enable RejectDirectSend in Exchange Online to harden domain spoofing protections?Mail flow from ACS Email dies.Not a hiccup. Not a delay. A full-on \"message rejected\" scenario as if we were doing unauthenticated direct send, which we're not.Open a case with Microsoft support, and I get a politely worded, totally useless response that boils down to:\"Yeah that\u2019s expected. Direct Send from accepted domains gets blocked when you flip the switch. Configure a connector or disable it.\"WHAT CONNECTOR? What are you even talking about?!ACS Email is not an Exchange Online workload. It authenticates through Azure, not Exchange. It doesn\u2019t use direct send, and there\u2019s no way to configure a connector for it in Exchange Online, nor should there be. This is literally Microsoft breaking their own mail platform with another Microsoft product\u2019s security feature.How do you even QA this kind of thing?So now we\u2019re in a position where a global mail solution billed as enterprise-grade and scalable for apps/services is dependent on Exchange Online not having one specific setting enabled, a setting that\u2019s there to prevent spoofing.Let me say that again: a security feature in EXO breaks Microsoft\u2019s own separate, authenticated, app-to-email service.The cherry on top: Support telling us to \u201cconfigure a partner connector\u201d and \u201ccheck SPF.\u201d As if this were a traditional SMTP relay scenario.No. This is a secure, authenticated service designed for cloud-first applications. You broke it by accident, and the response is basically, \"Oops, sorry.\"This is the kind of crap that makes IT pros want to jump ship and go live in the woods.Microsoft: Either separate your services properly or document the fact that internal product lines can silently brick each other.And no, I will not be \u201ctemporarily disabling\u201d domain spoofing protections because you couldn\u2019t design your systems to talk to each other.Unacceptablesubmitted by/u/Intrepid_Chard_3535[link][comments]",

    "summary": "In case you haven't already heard, EA has decided to actively block Proton, Wine or SteamDeck from running their brand new shooter, as they have already done for other titles of the saga, such as BF1.After the Windows 11 debacle and many users quitting Windows seemingly forever after being forced to buy new hardware to feed Bill Gates' already full pockets. it would be a step back for everyone in the Linux community and otherwise to simply roll over and take it up the ass when it comes to this new occurrence.I've already heard people in other subreddits pushing users to dual-boot what is essentially spy- and ad-ware on their machines, because there will be no other way to play this game, not only because EA and DICE are incompetent enough to produce anticheat that support Proton (much like EasyAntiCheat has been able to do forever) but also because they outright don't give a fuck about us users.I don't only refer to Linux users in the previous sentence, but to every single user of a PC anywhere in the world. What do EA care if you choose to play their brand spanking new game that costs 70 bucks on any hardware of your choosing? Why require SecureBoot to run the game? Are they that incompetent? Yes, but not only that, as I've already said! They simply don't give a fuck about consumers, and just want to make a quick buck out of you!We must all rise to the occasion by boycotting this game to show this company that their extortion techniques will be met with nothing less than outright war.Thank you very much for coming to my TED talk.EDIT:I'm told Bill Gates only owns 1% of Microsoft now. I extend my deeply felt hatred to all corpos running that particular company and all others that seek to destroy consumers in their endless greed. This includes, of course, Nvidia for refusing to collaborate in making open-source drivers for their cards unlike what AMD has been able to do.EDIT 2:Since I keep on seeing some points repeated over and over in the comment section, I would like to clarify my position on these.I didn't expect this post to have that much impact in the general PC community anyway. It was meant more as a reflection into how giving up on Windows after the Windows 11 debacle and then going back to dual-booting might not be an option for some users given they might not be unable to install Windows 11 at all, which is a kick in the face for consumers.There are (at least) two big camps of people in the comment section. One part says \"LOL just dual boot\". Again, this might not be an option for some people, and even if it is, it's a kick in the face to have to do so.Another camp says \"is it really a boycott if Linux doesn't support it so we can't install it?\" I know, that's the point behind the post, the idea of reinstalling Windows (if you are able to do so) just to play this game is stupid in my eyes, hence I made this rant post. Some people might feel inclined to do so, and I wanted to give them a counterargument against that decision.Once again, I don't expect 4% of the PC playerbase \"boycotting\" (or simply not being able to install) this game to have any impact, of course not, but it doesn't personally feel right to pay 70 bucks for a game I can't run on my machine unless I use what has turned out to be adware and spyware. It doesn't feel right to support outright incompetence/malice by giving them my money so they can run code within my computer's kernel because they can't / don't care enough to come up with a better solution. I know I'm preaching to the converted, just wanted to voice my opinion and reasoning once again.EDIT 3:To anyone thinking I'm somehow forcing people to boycott this game or do anything at all, I have no power over anyone, especially over the Internet, since I'm no Jedi. You sure better contact the Council if you think you have the ability to do so, but that ain't me. I also have no intention of turning \"this\" (this subreddit? this Linux community? I really don't know...) into a religion or a cult by imposing my views, as some commenters have stated.To everyone: kindly do whatever you want, I'm not holding you at gunpoint, I just wanted to voice my take.submitted by/u/ChemiCalChems[link][comments]",

This home is a stunning example of intentional maximalism, where every object and art piece is chosen with purpose and tells a part of her story.\n\nThe tour begins in a welcoming entryway featuring vibrant art celebrating Black girlhood, setting the tone for a home filled with identity and pride. From a tiny bathroom with unique vintage flooring to a cozy bedroom built around a cherished antique nightstand, personal history is woven into the fabric of the decor. The living room is the apartment's centerpiece, featuring a stunning gallery wall with works by artists like Mark Stoddart and Attos Setu, each piece holding deep significance. Across the room, colorful paintings by Kalkidan Assefa and Quinton Versetti bring the vibrancy of Toronto inside.\n\nBeyond the art, this tour is packed with inspiration for small space living. See how Lisa created a dedicated dining nook, uses a bookcase to display her love for literature (spines out!), and seamlessly integrates her cat's needs with stylish, functional furniture. From her views on displaying family photos to her love for the nostalgia of fridge magnets and memories of Honest Ed's, Lisa's tour is more than just interior design. It's a lesson in how to build a home that is a sanctuary of personal expression, community, and heritage.\n\n#apartmenttour #torontoapartment #hometour #artfilledhome #maximalism #intentionalmaximalism #blackart #pocart #interiordesign #toronto #smallapartment #olderapartment #vintageapartment #nevertoosmall #apartmenttherapy #theartofinteriors",

I think this violates the community rules, as this isn\u2019t an outside troubleshooting forum; it\u2019s a forum of Systems Administrators helping each other out, complaining about our jobs, and just anything we all go through. With all of the IT cuts and AI push, I don\u2019t think this should be the forum that allows this. Also, it should be fairly obvious who doesn\u2019t know the IT basics and just had some meetings to find out enough to seem to know what they\u2019re talking about.submitted by/u/iwantdatgold[link][comments]",

    "summary": "This homestead includes two handcrafted natural homes, a geodesic dome greenhouse built from local stone, a hand-dug stream, two natural swimming ponds, a bamboo maze, and a thriving permaculture garden and orchard with over 2,000 plants. It\u2019s a place where the home doesn\u2019t just shelter you\u2014it feeds you, cools and heats itself, filters your air, and invites you to slow down and live well.\n\nIt\u2019s the work of Vicente Nadal, a pioneer in natural building in his part of Spain, Pa\u00eds Valenci\u00e0. Tucked away in a quiet canyon near Alicante\u2014just beyond the bustle of the Mediterranean coast\u2014 he\u2019s blending ancient building knowledge with smart, low-tech innovation. Vicente believes the future lies in remembering what we've forgotten: using local materials, designing with the climate, and creating homes that actually give back.\n\nHere, nearly everything is made from stone, lime, and wood found on the land. The main house\u2014once a plain stucco structure\u2014is now full of organic curves and warmth, with thick walls that insulate and sculpted heated benches built into the design. The smaller home features a clever modular wall system that converts the open-plan studio into a two-bedroom layout in seconds. The dome greenhouse is not only functional, but striking\u2014built by hand with lime mortar and wood for growing food year-round.\n\nVicente designs homes that blend with nature and are health-enhancing. He uses lime plasters and paints inside and out, which naturally absorb CO\u2082, filter indoor air, and resist mold and bacteria. For cooling, a DIY \u201cCanadian Well\u201d system (AKA earth-coupled air cooling system) brings in fresh air from underground. For heating, thermal inertia stoves made with natural materials release warmth slowly over 24 hours using minimal wood\u2014heating both the space and the built-in seating with efficiency and beauty.\n\nThe land is shaped to support water and life: a meandering stream crosses under a stone Roman-style bridge, feeding two deep, natural ponds that help filter water and provide a habitat for frogs, dragonflies, and fish. There\u2019s even an outdoor limestone shower that, four years on, still looks like new\u2014thanks to limestone\u2019s natural resistance to stains and microbes.\n\nEven the finishing touches are rooted in local wisdom. Esparto blinds hang on the outside of windows, blocking harsh summer sun while letting in dappled light\u2014and on hot days, they can be misted to cool the air that enters the home. A treehouse built from leftover wood and salvaged windows, a mountain bike trail, and winding paths through the orchard show how joy, play, and function all coexist here. \n\nFor Vicente, this kind of building isn\u2019t a niche lifestyle\u2014it\u2019s a return to sanity. When you treat your home as an ecosystem, it becomes something that supports your health, grows your food, powers your comfort, and connects you to the land.\n\nhttps://www.rustega.es/\nUpdates about Vicente's builds  https://www.instagram.com/rustegabioconstruccion/\n\nOn *faircompanies: https://faircompanies.com/videos/building-private-eco-village-with-diy-stone-dome-and-full-ecosystem-%f0%9f%8c%bf%f0%9f%90%9f/",

    "summary": "Alex and Al started off as friends who decided to help each other build their own separate tiny homes, side by side.  But by the time their tiny home walls were framed, they had fallen in love.  So, they decided to build one of the tiny homes for them both to live in, and they finished and sold the other tiny house to help cover some of their expenses.  They\u2019ve been together for almost 6 years now and just recently got married!  They are still living in the tiny house together and say that it is even better than they hoped it would be!\n\nYou can follow and find out more about Alex's weaving at Alex Rooted here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/alexrooted\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@alexrooted\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@alexrooted\nhttps://www.alexrooted.com/\n\nTheir tiny house was built on a 24\u2019 long trailer, and it has 2\u2019 bump outs at each end, bringing the total length to 28\u2019.  The width is 8.5\u2019, and the height is 13.5\u2019.  The trailer they used is from Iron Eagle, and they chose it because the floor of the trailer is sunken down which provides some much needed vertical inches to make sure they had enough head room on the main floor and up in the loft.\n\nAlex and Al tried to use as many reclaimed and local materials as possible to reduce waste on the project, including using salvaged cedar shingles and planks for their siding, flooring from an old bowling alley, and locally milled wood.  For their interior walls, they used Wedi board and plastered it with venetian plaster for a stunning finish.\n\nStorage and space to cook were two major priorities with their design, so they have 38 large drawers to make sure they can keep the tiny space organized, and they have loads of counter space in the galley kitchen for preparing large meals and canning preserves.\n\nAlex and Al heat their tiny home with wood, and they made sure to get their wood stove WETT certified.  Another thing they did to help make sure they could get home insurance was to skirt their tiny home and remove the wheels.  By doing this, they were able to get mobile home insurance which was cheaper than tiny house insurance.\n\nTheir covered porch almost doubles their living space and was built using glass from secondhand sliding doors, and driftwood posts from a nearby beach.  The deck itself is built in sections so that it can be taken apart and moved if they have to find a new location.\n\nFinding parking for the tiny house was challenging and the couple is currently at their third location.  The first was an old covered mill where they began their build, but were evicted along with the other folks on the land.  The second was a nice forested site but it did not have any services so it was only used to complete their build.  Their third parking spot was found by putting up posters in the neighbourhoods where they wanted to live.  It has water, electricity, and septic, and they only had to bring in their own internet.  \n\nThe land rent is more affordable than renting an apartment or home in their area, and they also contribute to the landlords in other ways like chopping their firewood.  \n\nYou can follow and find out more about Alex's weaving at Alex Rooted here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/alexrooted\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@alexrooted\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@alexrooted\nhttps://www.alexrooted.com/\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nSTAY IN TOUCH!\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWebsite: www.exploringalternatives.ca\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/exploringalternativesblog\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/exploringalternatives/\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nCOMMENTS\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe want our channel and comments section to be an inclusive space where everyone feels welcome to watch and contribute.

In this video, we dive deep into the forced retirement crisis facing Boomers today. From age discrimination, AI replacing jobs, and the brutal realities of living on Social Security, this video uncovers why so many Boomers are not financially prepared to retire.\n\nWe\u2019ll explore why Boomers are being pushed out of the workforce, why many have little to no retirement savings, how the Great Recession impacted Late Boomers, and how a lack of financial literacy left an entire generation vulnerable.\n\nIf you\u2019re in your 20s, 30s, or 40s\u2014this is your warning. Forced retirement isn\u2019t just a Boomer problem. It\u2019s a generational reality that you might face someday. Learn how to prepare your finances, build retirement savings early, and avoid relying on Social Security or the system to save you.\n\n\n**This video is intended for entertainment purposes only, none of it should be interpreted as financial advice.

    "summary": "BEFORE STARTING (Please read)Some of the information on here may be incorrect or heavily dependent on specific situations and use cases. If you find anything that you think is useful to this guide, comment down below your suggestions and I will add it to this guide.But if you find anything in here that is incorrect, misleading or that does not work and etc, please comment down below so that I can further improve this guide.Please, help contribute to this guide if possible.Understanding some conceptsBefore starting, it is important that you understand some simple concepts for better understanding of your system, so that you can debug and figure out what you need and don't need to do.Desktop environment (DE):\"A desktop environment (DE) is an implementation of the desktop metaphor made of a bundle of programs, which share a common graphical user interface (GUI)\".Examples:KDE Plasma, XFCE, Hyprland, GNOME, Cinnamon and etc.Compositors: \"A compositor is a software which interacts with the window system as well as graphics in Linux to produce: Transparency in windows, Transition animations, Drop shadows around windows which give them a 3D effect, V sync: Waits for the display to update before updating the display\".Present modes:The presentation mode specifies when a frame is presented to the window. Can be discovered which one a game is using utilizing Mangohud, but, don't rely on it as it does not show precisely which presentation mode is being used a lot of the time. And also a common bug is that Mangohud does not update this field dynamically when gaming. So in some cases (like mine on THE FINALS) Mangohud will show FIFO but the game is actually running with Mailbox.Example:FIFO (V-Sync, FPS is locked to the monitor refresh rate), Mailbox (V-Sync but frame rate is not locked) and Immediate (No V-Sync, frame rate is not locked).Wayland:\"communication protocol that specifies the communication between a display server and its clients, as well as a C library implementation of that protocol.[9] A display server using the Wayland protocol is called a Wayland compositor, because it additionally performs the task of a compositing window manager\".X/X11/X Window system:\"The X Window System (X11, or simply X) is a windowing system for bitmap displays, common on Unix-like operating systems. X is an architecture-independent system for remote graphical user interfaces and input device capabilities. Each person using a networked terminal has the ability to interact with the display with any type of user input device\".DistrosA very common topic is which distro is better for X thing? In this case which distro is the best for gaming. Although there are some distros out there like Bazzite and NobaraOS, the most popular as of now is CachyOS (which is not a gaming focused distro but it's the best in terms of gaming performance). But, you first need to understand that distros focused on gamingwill notoutperform in FPS a common distro such as Endeavour, Arch, Manjaro and etc by alargemargin. Distros such as CachyOS, Bazzite and NobaraOS do get better performance in most cases (+2 to 5%), and specially better 1% lows.However, these gaming focused distros are not focused/optimized on other type of workloads. So if you are just a regular user that also does gaming, going for something like EndeavourOS myself is a good choice as the difference is not that noticeable.It's not that CachyOS, Bazzite or NobaraOS will let you down if try to do something else. It's just that the focus a distro has generally helps with a \"out-of-the-box\" experience. Setting up EndeavourOS for gaming is more tedious than Bazzite or NobaraOS for example.Video driversThe most important part in all this guide is this. Using the correct driver and DE/Compositor combo is important because if you are using a NVIDIA card, then using X11 will deliver better performance and lower latency.Since this a very extensive topic, I'll just link below some useful links for you to get started/inform yourself.[Linux Graphics Drivers explained: AMD, NVIDIA, INTEL, Open Source and Proprietary]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW1CLcT83as&t=109s&pp=ygURbGludXggYW1kIGRyaXZlcnPSBwkJxwkBhyohjO8%3D[NVIDIA GPUs on Linux: What You Need to Know (Open vs closed drivers, module, GSP firmware, etc...)]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XMoADlten8&pp=ygUebnZpZGlhIGdwdSBkcml2ZXJzIGxpbnV4IGd1aWRlGuide to installing AMD/NVIDIA drivers:https://github.com/lutris/docs/blob/master/InstallingDrivers.mdStarting with the tweaks1. Disable your DE composition.Disabling composition can increase your FPS and lower latency, specially if you are in a NVIDIA card.To bring more clarification, literally disabling your DE compositor is not possible because the compositor is what draws the picture in your screen. But, on display servers like X11, composition can be \"disabled\". That means that with composition \"disabled\" X11 will run in a bare-bones state, having lower latency.Is not possible if:You are Wayland.Is not necessary if:You have a AMD card.2. Use Gamescope.\"Gamescope is a micro-compositor from Valve that is used on the Steam Deck. Its goal is to provide an isolated compositor that is tailored towards gaming and supports many gaming-centric features such as:Spoofing resolutions.Up-scaling using AMD FidelityFX\u2122 Super Resolution or NVIDIA Image Scaling.Limiting frame rates.As a micro-compositor it is designed to run as a nested session on top of your existing desktop environment though it is also possible to use it as an embedded compositor as well\".How to use it?Set as launch options:gamescope(before %command% if you are on Steam)Arguments:-fForces exclusive full-screen.-w -hSets the window width (-w) and window height (-h)-rThe refresh rate--force-grab-cursor\"Creates\" a new cursor inside the window that stays locked inside the window unless Alt+Tab. Can decrease latency.--immediate-flipsForces the application to enable screen tearing.Usage example:gamescope -f -w 1920 -h 1080 -r 180 --force-grab-cursor --immediate-flips -- %command%(must include the--before %command%).3. Enable VRR (Variable Refresh Rate/Free-sync). Preferably, set it to \"Automatic\".4. DE/Window manager specific:KDE:Enable the \"Allow tearing on full-screen applications\" options in the display configuration;KDE:UseKWIN_DRM_NO_AMS=1environment variable;Sway:Useallow_tearing yeswithWLR_DRM_NO_MODIFIERS=1andWLR_DRM_NO_ATOMIC=1(Warning! NO_MODIFIERS and NO_ATOMIC can cause your PC to boot into a black screen if you have a NVIDIA card. And as reported by a user, these options can make your system slower. So do your own testing.);Hyprland:UseDirect_Scanout=1.5. Set power mode to performance (Can be done both for the CPU and GPU with CoreCtrl).6. Environment variables:MESA_VK_WSI_PRESENT_MODE=immediateReduces latency;Forces Mesa\u2019s Vulkan WSI to use VK_PRESENT_MODE_IMMEDIATE regardless of application preference.KWIN_DRM_NO_AMS=1Reduces latency;Disables Kernel-mode \u201cadaptive modeset\u201d (AMS) scheduling in KWin/DRM Wayland backend. AMS might delay cursor updates and composite operations under GPU load.PROTON_USE_NTSYNC=1Can reduce latency (it did for me on THE FINALS);Enables native NTSync support in ProtonGE (Version 10-9, 10-10 enables it by default) synchronizes Vulkan & OpenGL submissions using Linux ntsync kernel module rather than Wine\u2019s own fsync/esync.PROTON_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1Can reduce latency and improves performance if you are on Wayland;Tells Proton to use the native winewayland.drv backend instead of XWayland/X11 so games run as pure Wayland clients.SDL_VIDEODRIVER=waylandCan reduce latency and improves performance if you are on Wayland;Forces SDL2 apps to use Wayland back-end instead of defaulting to X11/XWayland. Without it, SDL2 usually uses X11 even under Wayland unless compiled otherwise.7. Use a different kernel.If you are on a gaming focused distro then this is not necessary because those distros already have a custom modified kernel made specifically for gaming. But, if you are not using a gaming focused distro, then this is could prove to be helpful. As it can increase gaming performance and lower latency (measured by an average of 2ms). Such as my case that improved stability. But, do be aware that those kernels have custom schedulers and they can have other issues. So, do your testing to see if it fits you.The most common kernel for this use case is Linux-Zen, which is the one I'm using right now. It solved a problem I've been dealing with Arch that in certain cases, most primarily gaming, OS freezes can happen, making the whole OS become unresponsive and freeze under heavy workloads. In BeamNG I had a problem where the game would freeze with the OS for about a couple of minutes every time something new had to load. This went away when I used Linux-Zen, which decreases latency by an average of 2ms.8. Use a different DE.Desktop environments such as KDE have the highest latency. If you want a light-weight DE or just one that has lower input latency, use Hyprland or XFCE.A recent testing has been done regarding this topic:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UG8WeX_h1VGytK1Tz-56gETmzsM2CPiwXS9BoZ-1F60/edit?gid=0#gid=0(It's a more recent up to date version from this post made by the same person:https://www.reddit.com/r/linux\\_gaming/comments/1mejrig/linuxwayland\\_vs\\_win11\\_click\\_to\\_photon\\_latency/)9. Use LatencyFleX to use NVIDIA Reflex and AMD Anti Lag.\"Vendor agnostic latency reduction middle-ware. An alternative to NVIDIA Reflex\". LatencyFleX is a tool that can be used to enable the Reflex feature on NVIDIA and Anti Lag on AMD cards.THIS IS A USE AT YOUR OWN RISK TOOL, THIS CAN RESULT IN A GAME BAN ON GAMES SUCH AS CS2/THE FINALS/OVERWATCH ETC... (Although some players have reported not getting banned using this, still, be careful when using it).LatencyFleX GitHub:https://github.com/ishitatsuyuki/LatencyFleXVideo that explains in more depth and also includes a tutorial:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvmkSftYyP8&t=188s&pp=ygUSbGludXggbGF0ZW5jeSBmbGV410. General knowledge, common occurrences and possible fixes/causes.Higher frames reduces tearing and latency, making the experience more smooth and responsive (Higher frames with no V-Sync feels more responsive than higher frames with V-Sync).High GPU usage can cause more input latency. So playing at 99% GPU usage at 220 FPS has more latency than 90% GPU usage at 200 FPS for example (If you use Reflex or Anti Lag then this is not a issue).Input lag,can be caused by:Your compositor forces V-Sync;V-Sync turned on in-game;Game/Proton/Wine incompatibility;Border-less or windowed mode have higher latency than exclusive full-screen (This is not true on Wayland as far knowledge goes, but setting a game to full-screen will enable the \"Allow tearing on full-screen applications\" on KDE to take effect).;Check if your compositor is compositing in general or if only is compositing in full-screen applications.Useful for solving this problem:Environment variables;Disabling V-Sync;\"Allow tearing on full-screen applications\" should be enabled on KDE;Gamescope with forced full-screen (-f and --immediate-flips);Use NTSYNC with ProtonGE;Force your compositor to not use V-Sync (if possible);VRR (Variable refresh rate/Free-sync) enabled;Use X11 instead of Wayland, specially on NVIDIA.---Stutters,can be caused by (assuming your hardware is not the problem):Shader compilation;Game incompatibility with Linux;Proton version.Useful for solving this problem:Try dxvk-gplasync:https://gitlab.com/Ph42oN/dxvk-gplasync;Use Gamemode;Disable overlays (Generally do not have any impact, so test it out to se if it helps);Set your power profile to performance (CoreCtrl can be used for this);Different kernel;Older or wrong drivers, specially video drivers if this issue is global.?.(Not related to latency but useful):Disable mouse acceleration.Use Feral Gamemode.(Some of the texts and sources used for this guide are directly from sites, videos and wikis, but I can not link them here due to Reddit spam filters)submitted by/u/SadBrazilian7[link][comments]",

    "summary": "Morning folks,I've been using Bazzite for a few weeks now, quite happy with the general user experience. I've noticed however that there are a lot of things which I want to do as a developer that are major friction points. Today's the latest example: I want to install aG13 driverso I can use my keypad when playing games, and the process is a series of reboots to install libraries through rpm-ostree. I need libusb1-devel and java-latest-openjdk.x86_64 (one reboot). Next I need the gtk library (second reboot, which I don't want to do yet). As a programmer, I've noticed a few other libraries I've wanted are missing now and then, and I've just given up on doing work on this computer and working on a more permissive VM instead.Am I missing something? Is the intention to just build everything from source now if I'm doing development and ignore the conveniences of installing precompiled libraries? Or am I really supposed to reboot my computer half a dozen to a dozen times to install a chain of libraries as I encounter the next layer of missing libraries?Addendum: Lots of solid opinions and feedback. In particular the vibe I was getting from distrobox is \"it's Podman masquerading as WSL\", but I can see it's not quite that simple. I was able to make the driver compile in a distrobox and it functions outside of it as a user space program, so good to know on that front. I'm not familiar with packaging things for homebrew so I guess I have a new thing to look into.submitted by/u/Feynt[link][comments]",

Plasma just dies and I am left with a black screen even after I exit the game. Plasma gives me this weird readback if I try to fiddle with it.The only way I have found to fix it was to open the Plasma Renderer using the Terminal and \"kcmshell6 kcm_qtquicksettings\" and setting thr 'Rendering Backend' to 'Automatic'.The only problem is that when I play Arma again, the same thing happens. I look at the Rendering Backend again and somehow it's set to 'Software'. And it just breaks until I set it back to AutomaticWhat's a permanent Fix?

I have an Xbox Series S, but no desire to pay GamePass anymore, i have Windows 10 on my main rig (and 11 on my hp laptop) but even less desire to keep paying money to Microsoft for a lot of reason,So i searched and found Bazzite.

His IT knowledge is on par with the rest of the team.Our manager is chill in the sense that as long as you do your tickets and work on your project, he is not on top of you, but on the other hand, this guy always tries to pseudo-manage people.I already confirmed this is not a me thing, and the other guys think the same thing.I'm not a confrontational type of person, but this guy is getting to me; I'm about to start shit. I just want to rant a bit because it is starting to frustrate me.Update: I forgot to add, based on his personality, I'm 100% sure that he is aiming to be the next in line for the manager position, so my fear is that anything I say or do could come back to bite me.submitted by/u/shiraco415[link][comments]",

No one else can do his job so here I am with this shit.6 years ago we hired a new CTO who blew millions of dollars on a rebuild of the entire application in Azure.

I had an intense day with it yesterday auto-mounting, reformatting Ntfs drives to Btrfs, suspicious cloned drives, but all of it has helped me step out of my comfort zone. I briefly considered switching back to Windows, but that thought disappeared when I researched other distros. I'm grateful I chose Bazzite instead of Mint or Pop because I prioritize gaming above all else, and those other options couldn't support me as well as this one has.I'm learning basic stuff like mentioned above, getting used and learning each day and after solving it gets to a satisfying level. I wanna thank everyone in the discord who helped me and the people from my first post who pushed me further to hug the penguin, right now I'm learning ujust terminal commands and bookmarked some tutorials because one day I might start to use the terminal more but time we'll see.Just today I've found alternatives for WinRAR or Office, and PeaZip with LibreOffice will do the work just fine.

It tells Tiny's life story, framed around the marathon performance footage, while highlighting his many eccentricities, religious convictions and others hangups as captured by Sharp's camera crews in both Australia and the United States.",

    "summary": "Step inside this absolutely breathtaking modern tiny home set deep in the heart of the Australian rainforest. Here amongst the towering trees, tiny house magic has been created!  Built by superyacht captain Johny, this stunning rainforest tiny house is a personal paradise, designed as the ultimate retreat from the world. When he's not sailing the globe with the rich and famous, Johny returns to this peaceful sanctuary to surf, recharge, and reconnect with nature.\n\nThe home itself is a masterclass in tiny house design. With a single-level layout and a focus on openness and flow, it makes the most of its lush surroundings. Massive picture windows bring the forest inside, creating a seamless connection to the outdoors. The home feels expansive, calm, and deeply rooted in its environment.\n\nOutside, the landscaping is equally as impressive. A generous deck expands the living area into the forest, while natural elements like boulders and large timber logs have been thoughtfully placed to ground the home in the landscape. It\u2019s the perfect blend of modern design and raw, untamed nature.\n\nThis is a tiny home that you won't want to miss. We absolutely loved getting to visit this rainforest retreat and share Johny\u2019s incredible story with you. We hope you enjoy the tour as much as we did.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f If you enjoy our show and would like to help support our work, please consider supporting us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/livingbig\n\n\ud83c\udf1f Our Socials and Links: https://linktr.ee/livingbig\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Find out more about this tiny house and others on our website: https://www.livingbiginatinyhouse.com/\n\nPlease subscribe for more videos on tiny houses, architecture, DIY, design, and sustainable, off-grid living.\n\nPresented and Produced by: Bryce Langston\nCamera: Rasa Pescud & Bryce Langston\nEditing:  Sarah Binder & Rasa Pescud\n\nAdditional video supplied by Johny\n\nTitle music in this video by Bryce Langston: http://www.youtube.com/brycelangston\n\n'Living Big in a Tiny House' \u00a9 2025 Zyia Pictures Ltd\n\n#tinyhouse #tinyhousetour #rainforest #tinyhouseparadise #tinyhome #innature  #homedesign",
