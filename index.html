<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQnZkuAZEDI" target="_blank">Building private eco-village with DIY stone dome & full ecosystem (Alicante) üåøüêü</a></h2>
<p class="published-date">2025-08-03 15:59:29</p>
<p class="feed-title">Kirsten Dirksen</p>
<button class="toggle-summary-btn" data-target="summary-8">...</button>
<div id="summary-8" class="summary" style="display: none;">This off-grid homestead includes two handcrafted natural homes, a geodesic dome greenhouse built from local stone, a hand-dug stream, two natural swimming ponds, a bamboo maze, and a thriving permaculture garden and orchard with over 2,000 plants. It‚Äôs a place where the home doesn‚Äôt just shelter you‚Äîit feeds you, cools and heats itself, filters your air, and invites you to slow down and live well.

It‚Äôs the work of Vicente Nadal, a pioneer in natural building in his part of Spain. Tucked away in a quiet canyon near Alicante‚Äîjust beyond the bustle of the Mediterranean coast‚Äî he‚Äôs blending ancient building knowledge with smart, low-tech innovation. Vicente believes the future lies in remembering what we've forgotten: using local materials, designing with the climate, and creating homes that actually give back.

Here, nearly everything is made from stone, lime, and wood found on the land. The main house‚Äîonce a plain stucco structure‚Äîis now full of organic curves and warmth, with thick walls that insulate and sculpted heated benches built into the design. The smaller home features a clever modular wall system that converts the open-plan studio into a two-bedroom layout in seconds. 

The dome greenhouse is not only functional, but striking‚Äîbuilt by hand with lime mortar and wood for growing food year-round.

Vicente designs homes that are off-grid and health-enhancing. He uses lime plasters and paints inside and out, which naturally absorb CO‚ÇÇ, filter indoor air, and resist mold and bacteria. For cooling, a DIY ‚ÄúCanadian Well‚Äù system (AKA earth-coupled air cooling system) brings in fresh air from underground. For heating, thermal inertia stoves made with natural materials release warmth slowly over 24 hours using minimal wood‚Äîheating both the space and the built-in seating with efficiency and beauty.

The land is shaped to support water and life: a meandering stream crosses under a stone Roman-style bridge, feeding two deep, natural ponds that help filter water and provide a habitat for frogs, dragonflies, and fish. There‚Äôs even an outdoor limestone shower that, four years on, still looks like new‚Äîthanks to limestone‚Äôs natural resistance to stains and microbes.

Even the finishing touches are rooted in local wisdom. Esparto blinds hang on the outside of windows, blocking harsh summer sun while letting in dappled light‚Äîand on hot days, they can be misted to cool the air that enters the home. A treehouse built from leftover wood and salvaged windows, a mountain bike trail, and winding paths through the orchard show how joy, play, and function all coexist here. 

For Vicente, this kind of building isn‚Äôt a niche lifestyle‚Äîit‚Äôs a return to sanity. When you treat your home as an ecosystem, it becomes something that supports your health, grows your food, powers your comfort, and connects you to the land.

<button class="toggle-summary-btn" data-target="summary-16">...</button>
<div id="summary-16" class="summary" style="display: none;">Alex and Al started off as friends who decided to help each other build their own separate tiny homes, side by side.  But by the time their tiny home walls were framed, they had fallen in love.  So, they decided to build one of the tiny homes for them both to live in, and they finished and sold the other tiny house to help cover some of their expenses.  They‚Äôve been together for almost 6 years now and just recently got married!  They are still living in the tiny house together and say that it is even better than they hoped it would be!

Their tiny house was built on a 24‚Äô long trailer, and it has 2‚Äô bump outs at each end, bringing the total length to 28‚Äô.  The width is 8.5‚Äô, and the height is 13.5‚Äô.  The trailer they used is from Iron Eagle, and they chose it because the floor of the trailer is sunken down which provides some much needed vertical inches to make sure they had enough head room on the main floor and up in the loft.

Alex and Al tried to use as many reclaimed and local materials as possible to reduce waste on the project, including using salvaged cedar shingles and planks for their siding, flooring from an old bowling alley, and locally milled wood.  For their interior walls, they used Wedi board and plastered it with venetian plaster for a stunning finish.

Storage and space to cook were two major priorities with their design, so they have 38 large drawers to make sure they can keep the tiny space organized, and they have loads of counter space in the galley kitchen for preparing large meals and canning preserves.

Alex and Al heat their tiny home with wood, and they made sure to get their wood stove WETT certified.  Another thing they did to help make sure they could get home insurance was to skirt their tiny home and remove the wheels.  By doing this, they were able to get mobile home insurance which was cheaper than tiny house insurance.

Their covered porch almost doubles their living space and was built using glass from secondhand sliding doors, and driftwood posts from a nearby beach.  The deck itself is built in sections so that it can be taken apart and moved if they have to find a new location.

Finding parking for the tiny house was challenging and the couple is currently at their third location.  The first was an old covered mill where they began their build, but were evicted along with the other folks on the land.  The second was a nice forested site but it did not have any services so it was only used to complete their build.  Their third parking spot was found by putting up posters in the neighbourhoods where they wanted to live.  It has water, electricity, and septic, and they only had to bring in their own internet.  

The land rent is more affordable than renting an apartment or home in their area, and they also contribute to the landlords in other ways like chopping their firewood.

<div id="summary-24" class="summary" style="display: none;">Brits are already getting around Discord‚Äôs age verification using Death Stranding‚Äôs photo mode. We tested it. It works.

This video walks through reports from PC Gamer, protests using mock IDs of UK MPs, and a public demo on X by security consultant Paul Moore that used an image of Technology Secretary Peter Kyle to beat an age-verification tool. We also cover the legal warning from CyberNews about identity theft and why criticism of the UK‚Äôs Online Safety Act is growing. Finally, we look at the surge of VPN apps in the UK App Store.

This video is for reporting and education. Do not use fake IDs. That can be identity theft.

00:00 The Quiet Crisis
02:27 Chapter 1: How It All Ends
04:41 Chapter 2: Why The Boomers Are Being Pushed Out
08:15 Chapter 3: Why Boomers Are Not Ready For Retirement
13:12 Chapter 4: The Real Cost of Forced Retirement
17:06 Chapter 5: What We Should Learn from This


Millions of Baby Boomers are quietly being forced into retirement‚Äîand it‚Äôs not the peaceful, planned transition they hoped for. In this video, we dive deep into the forced retirement crisis facing Boomers today. From age discrimination, AI replacing jobs, and the brutal realities of living on Social Security, this video uncovers why so many Boomers are not financially prepared to retire.

We‚Äôll explore why Boomers are being pushed out of the workforce, why many have little to no retirement savings, how the Great Recession impacted Late Boomers, and how a lack of financial literacy left an entire generation vulnerable.

If you‚Äôre in your 20s, 30s, or 40s‚Äîthis is your warning. Forced retirement isn‚Äôt just a Boomer problem. It‚Äôs a generational reality that you might face someday. Learn how to prepare your finances, build retirement savings early, and avoid relying on Social Security or the system to save you.

<div id="summary-43" class="summary" style="display: none;">Nathy Peluso brought the fire to the streets of New York in one of the most electric episodes we‚Äôve filmed. From reggaeton to salsa to soul, she showed off her incredible range‚Äîcalling Missy Elliott and Erykah Badu her queens and tying a Frankie Ruiz classic to her own music. Between learning English through Frank Sinatra, shouting out her friend J Balvin, and hyping up the Madrid music scene, Nathy had us laughing, singing, and even dancing salsa. You don‚Äôt want to miss this one.

This Episode's Track List:
RITMO (Bad Boys for Life) - J Balvin, Black Eyed Peas
DESPECH√Å - ROSAL√çA
The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly) - Missy Elliott
AMARGURA - KAROL G
Somethin‚Äô Stupid - Frank Sinatra, Nancy Sinatra

Let's meet our hosts!
- Jake Baldino (aka the Before You Buy Guy) is pretty much the most watched reviewer on YouTube across both Gameranx and his personal channel (https://www.youtube.com/c/JakeBaldino). If you're obsessed with Delorians, The Mummy and Pizza you can discuss that stuff with him directly over on Twitter:  @JakeBaldino

- Lucy James is a Senior Producer at Gamespot. She's actually, like, experienced and credentialed and has real life skills and stuff, while the rest of the gang would be funemployed if the YT algorithm didn't kiss them for random, inexplicable reasons. 

- Skill Up used to work at McDonalds but he got fired for skimming too many chicken nuggets. He says he regrets it since he hasn't had a better job since.</div>

<div id="summary-49" class="summary" style="display: none;">The Nothing Headphone (1) might be my favourite set of over-ear headphones right now.
ALL MY FAVORITE GEAR IS LISTED BELOW üëá


I've been testing the Nothing Headphone (1) for a week now, and these transparent headphones are definitely unique. At $299, they pack premium features like 80-hour battery life, KEF-tuned drivers, and even ChatGPT integration. The build quality feels solid with aluminum construction, and the sound is surprisingly good for the price point. But there are some trade-offs you should know about before buying. I'll break down the real-world performance, comfort during long sessions, and whether these transparent headphones are worth choosing over more traditional options.

<div id="summary-55" class="summary" style="display: none;">BEFORE STARTING (Please read)Some of the information on here may be incorrect or heavily dependent on specific situations and use cases. If you find anything that you think is useful to this guide, comment down below your suggestions and I will add it to this guide.But if you find anything in here that is incorrect, misleading or that does not work and etc, please comment down below so that I can further improve this guide.Please, help contribute to this guide if possible.Understanding some conceptsBefore starting, it is important that you understand some simple concepts for better understanding of your system, so that you can debug and figure out what you need and don't need to do.Desktop environment (DE):"A desktop environment (DE) is an implementation of the desktop metaphor made of a bundle of programs, which share a common graphical user interface (GUI)".Examples:KDE Plasma, XFCE, Hyprland, GNOME, Cinnamon and etc.Compositors: "A compositor is a software which interacts with the window system as well as graphics in Linux to produce: Transparency in windows, Transition animations, Drop shadows around windows which give them a 3D effect, V sync: Waits for the display to update before updating the display".Present modes:The presentation mode specifies when a frame is presented to the window. Can be discovered which one a game is using utilizing Mangohud, but, don't rely on it as it does not show precisely which presentation mode is being used a lot of the time. And also a common bug is that Mangohud does not update this field dynamically when gaming. So in some cases (like mine on THE FINALS) Mangohud will show FIFO but the game is actually running with Mailbox.Example:FIFO (V-Sync, FPS is locked to the monitor refresh rate), Mailbox (V-Sync but frame rate is not locked) and Immediate (No V-Sync, frame rate is not locked).Wayland:"communication protocol that specifies the communication between a display server and its clients, as well as a C library implementation of that protocol.[9] A display server using the Wayland protocol is called a Wayland compositor, because it additionally performs the task of a compositing window manager".X/X11/X Window system:"The X Window System (X11, or simply X) is a windowing system for bitmap displays, common on Unix-like operating systems. X is an architecture-independent system for remote graphical user interfaces and input device capabilities. Each person using a networked terminal has the ability to interact with the display with any type of user input device".DistrosA very common topic is which distro is better for X thing? In this case which distro is the best for gaming. Although there are some distros out there (Bazzite NobaraOS), the most popular as of now is CachyOS (which is not a gaming focused distro but it's the best in terms of gaming performance). But, you first need to understand that distros focused on gamingwill notoutperform in FPS a common distro such as Endeavour, Arch, Manjaro and etc by alargemargin. Distros such as CachyOS, Bazzite and NobaraOS do get better performance in most cases (+2 to 5%), and specially better 1% lows.However, these gaming focused distros are not focused/optimized on other type of workloads. So if you are just a regular user that also does gaming, going for something like EndeavourOS myself is a good choice as the difference is not that noticeable.But, it's not that CachyOS, Bazzite or NobaraOS will let you down if try to do something else. It's just that the focus a distro has generally helps with a "out-of-the-box" experience. Setting up EndeavourOS for gaming is more tedious than Bazzite or NobaraOS for example.Video driversThe most important part in all this guide is this. Using the correct driver and DE/Compositor combo is important because if you are using a NVIDIA card, then using X11 will deliver better performance and lower latency.Since this a very extensive topic, I'll just link below some useful links for you to get started/inform yourself.[Linux Graphics Drivers explained: AMD, NVIDIA, INTEL, Open Source and Proprietary]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW1CLcT83as&t=109s&pp=ygURbGludXggYW1kIGRyaXZlcnPSBwkJxwkBhyohjO8%3D[NVIDIA GPUs on Linux: What You Need to Know (Open vs closed drivers, module, GSP firmware, etc...)]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XMoADlten8&pp=ygUebnZpZGlhIGdwdSBkcml2ZXJzIGxpbnV4IGd1aWRlGuide to installing AMD/NVIDIA drivers:https://github.com/lutris/docs/blob/master/InstallingDrivers.mdStarting with the tweaks1. Disable your DE composition.Disabling composition can increase your FPS and lower latency, specially if you are in a NVIDIA card.Is not necessary on:AMD with Wayland (Only if you want lower latency, does not generally affect performance).Is not possible if:You are using KDE Plasma with Wayland.2. Use Gamescope."Gamescope is a micro-compositor from Valve that is used on the Steam Deck. Its goal is to provide an isolated compositor that is tailored towards gaming and supports many gaming-centric features such as:Spoofing resolutions.Up-scaling using AMD FidelityFX‚Ñ¢ Super Resolution or NVIDIA Image Scaling.Limiting frame rates.As a micro-compositor it is designed to run as a nested session on top of your existing desktop environment though it is also possible to use it as an embedded compositor as well".How to use it?Set as launch options:gamescope(before %command% if you are on Steam)Arguments:-fForces exclusive full-screen.-w -hSets the window width (-w) and window height (-h)-rThe refresh rate--force-grab-cursor"Creates" a new cursor inside the window that stays locked inside the window unless Alt+Tab. Can decrease latency.--immediate-flipsForces the application to enable screen tearing.Usage example:gamescope -f -w 1920 -h 1080 -r 180 --force-grab-cursor --immediate-flips -- %command%(must include the--before %command%).3. Enable VRR (Variable Refresh Rate/Free-sync). Preferably, set it to "Automatic".4. DE/Window manager specific:KDE:Enable the "Allow tearing on full-screen applications" options in the display configuration;KDE:UseKWIN_DRM_NO_AMS=1environment variable;Sway:Useallow\_tearing yeswithWLR_DRM_NO_MODIFIERS=1andWLR_DRM_NO_ATOMIC=1;Hyprland:UseDirect_Scanout=1.5. Set power mode to performance (Can be done both for the CPU and GPU with CoreCtrl).6. Environment variables:MESA_VK_WSI_PRESENT_MODE=immediateReduces latency;Forces Mesa‚Äôs Vulkan WSI to use VK_PRESENT_MODE_IMMEDIATE regardless of application preference.KWIN_DRM_NO_AMS=1Reduces latency;Disables Kernel-mode ‚Äúadaptive modeset‚Äù (AMS) scheduling in KWin/DRM Wayland backend. AMS might delay cursor updates and composite operations under GPU load.PROTON_USE_NTSYNC=1Can reduce latency (it did for me on THE FINALS);Enables native NTSync support in ProtonGE (Version 10-9, 10-10 enables it by default) synchronizes Vulkan & OpenGL submissions using Linux ntsync kernel module rather than Wine‚Äôs own fsync/esync.PROTON_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1Can reduce latency and improves performance if you are on Wayland;Tells Proton to use the native winewayland.drv backend instead of XWayland/X11 so games run as pure Wayland clients.SDL_VIDEODRIVER=waylandCan reduce latency and improves performance if you are on Wayland;Forces SDL2 apps to use Wayland back-end instead of defaulting to X11/XWayland. Without it, SDL2 usually uses X11 even under Wayland unless compiled otherwise.7. Use a different kernel.If you are on CachyOS or other gaming focused distro then this is not necessary because those distros already have a custom modified kernel made specifically for gaming. But, if you are not using a gaming focused distro, then this is could prove to be helpful, as it can increase gaming performance and lower latency (measured by an average of 2ms). Such as my case that improved stability. But, do be aware that those kernels have custom schedulers and they can have other issues. So, do your testing to see if it fits you.The most common kernel for this use case is Linux-Zen, which is the one I'm using right now. It solved a problem I've been dealing with Arch that in certain cases, most primarily gaming, OS freezes can happen, making the whole OS become unresponsive and freeze under heavy workloads. In BeamNG I had a problem where the game would freeze with the OS for about a couple of minutes every time something new had to load. This went away when I used Linux-Zen, which decreases latency by an average of 2ms.8. Use a different DE.Desktop environments such as KDE have the highest latency. If you want a light-weight DE or just one that has lower input latency, use Hyprland or XFCE.A recent testing has been done regarding this topic:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UG8WeX_h1VGytK1Tz-56gETmzsM2CPiwXS9BoZ-1F60/edit?gid=0#gid=0(It's a more recent up to date version from this post made by the same person:https://www.reddit.com/r/linux\_gaming/comments/1mejrig/linuxwayland\_vs\_win11\_click\_to\_photon\_latency/)9. Use LatencyFleX to use NVIDIA Reflex and AMD Anti Lag."Vendor agnostic latency reduction middle-ware. An alternative to NVIDIA Reflex". LatencyFleX is a tool that can be used to enable the Reflex feature on NVIDIA and Anti Lag on AMD cards.THIS IS A USE AT YOUR OWN RISK TOOL, THIS CAN RESULT IN A GAME BAN ON GAMES SUCH AS CS2/THE FINALS/OVERWATCH ETC... (Although some players have reported not getting banned using this, still, be careful when using it).LatencyFleX GitHub:https://github.com/ishitatsuyuki/LatencyFleXVideo that explains in more depth and also includes a tutorial:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvmkSftYyP8&t=188s&pp=ygUSbGludXggbGF0ZW5jeSBmbGV410. General knowledge, common occurrences and possible fixes/causes.Higher frames reduces tearing and latency, making the experience more smooth and responsive (Higher frames with no V-Sync feels more responsive than higher frames with V-Sync).High GPU usage can cause more input latency. So playing at 99% GPU usage at 220 FPS has more latency than 90% GPU usage at 200 FPS for example (If you use Reflex or Anti Lag then this is not a issue).Input lag,can be caused by:Your compositor forces V-Sync;V-Sync turned on in-game;Game/Proton/Wine incompatibility;Border-less or windowed mode have higher latency than exclusive full-screen (This is not true on Wayland as far knowledge goes, but setting a game to full-screen will enable the "Allow tearing on full-screen applications" on KDE to take effect.;Check if your compositor is compositing in general or if only is compositing in full-screen applications.Useful for solving this problem:Environment variables;Disabling V-Sync;"Allow tearing on full-screen applications" should be enabled on KDE;Gamescope with forced full-screen (-f and --immediate-flips);Use NTSYNC with ProtonGE;Force your compositor to not use V-Sync (if possible);VRR (Variable refresh rate/Free-sync) enabled;Use X11 instead of Wayland, specially on NVIDIA.---Stutters,can be caused by (assuming your hardware is not the problem):Shader compilation;Game incompatibility with Linux;Proton version.Useful for solving this problem:Try dxvk-gplasync:https://gitlab.com/Ph42oN/dxvk-gplasync;Use Gamemode;Disable overlays (Generally do not have any impact, so test it out to se if it helps);Set your power profile to performance (CoreCtrl can be used for this);Different kernel;Older or wrong drivers, specially video drivers if this issue is global.?.(Not related to latency but useful):Disable mouse acceleration.Use Feral Gamemode.(Some of the texts and sources used for this guide are directly from sites, videos and wikis, but I can not link them here due to Reddit spam filters)submitted by/u/SadBrazilian7[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-56" class="summary" style="display: none;">Elgato sent me the camera to review but I was not told what to say or paid for the review. To be honest, I like the webcam a lot. I think that the colors are more accurate in the Elgato Facecam 4k. 

The biggest perk about the Elgato 4k webcam are: 
- It shoots in 4k 60fps 
- You can add camera filters
- You can have Custom LUTs (custom settings)
- AI Backgrounds

Elgato products do cost a bit of a premium but they are also a premium product. If you want to pick up an elgato 4k webcam, use my amazon affiliate link here:

<div id="summary-58" class="summary" style="display: none;">Morning folks,I've been using Bazzite for a few weeks now, quite happy with the general user experience. I've noticed however that there are a lot of things which I want to do as a developer that are major friction points. Today's the latest example: I want to install aG13 driverso I can use my keypad when playing games, and the process is a series of reboots to install libraries through rpm-ostree. I need libusb1-devel and java-latest-openjdk.x86_64 (one reboot). Next I need the gtk library (second reboot, which I don't want to do yet). As a programmer, I've noticed a few other libraries I've wanted are missing now and then, and I've just given up on doing work on this computer and working on a more permissive VM instead.Am I missing something? Is the intention to just build everything from source now if I'm doing development and ignore the conveniences of installing precompiled libraries? Or am I really supposed to reboot my computer half a dozen to a dozen times to install a chain of libraries as I encounter the next layer of missing libraries?Addendum: Lots of solid opinions and feedback. In particular the vibe I was getting from distrobox is "it's Podman masquerading as WSL", but I can see it's not quite that simple. I was able to make the driver compile in a distrobox and it functions outside of it as a user space program, so good to know on that front. I'm not familiar with packaging things for homebrew so I guess I have a new thing to look into.submitted by/u/Feynt[link][comments]</div>

Everything worked but upon reboot I let it Windows Update do its business because I didn't want the user to have to wait ages for backlog pending updates. First reboot after applying updates and all the junk was there, apps such as Spotify (IT'S A VM!!!), Microsoft Solitaire, Climpchamp and whatnot. Oh and Skype, which is already EOL. The VM is supposed to run government legacy apps only, not even Office, Chrome or multimedia codecs are necessary, only a shared folder with the host to export generated CSV and other files.What the heck Microsoft?submitted by/u/NETkoholik[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-65" class="summary" style="display: none;">So I have inly encountered this with Arma 3 so far.Booting the game is fine and it actually runs great compared to Windows. But the problem comes if I alt-tab, which I need to do in order to set up stuff like Discord streaming or Teamspeak for radio mods.The first time it's fine, but after the 2nd or so it really breaks everything. Plasma just dies and I am left with a black screen even after I exit the game. Plasma gives me this weird readback if I try to fiddle with it.The only way I have found to fix it was to open the Plasma Renderer using the Terminal and "kcmshell6 kcm_qtquicksettings" and setting thr 'Rendering Backend' to 'Automatic'.The only problem is that when I play Arma again, the same thing happens. I look at the Rendering Backend again and somehow it's set to 'Software'. And it just breaks until I set it back to AutomaticWhat's a permanent Fix? How can I prevent this from happening?submitted by/u/Blockhead_Gundam[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-68" class="summary" style="display: none;">I asked ChatGPT to motivate me this morning to go for a walk, which my instance did with sass and humour perfectly, but as I said where I wanted to go it offered to be a tour guide.I put my headphones used standard voice mode and told ChatGPT where I was and it accurately and informatively told me about the history of my city, and landmarks I would see on my route.The walk took 1hr 20mins it never lost context and always knew which landmark was next along the route.I know a lot about the history of my city but I learnt a few new facts and I was genuinely impressed! There were no hallucinations either!I would recommend anyone trying ChatGPT as a tour guide.submitted by/u/Potential-Ad-9082[link][comments]</div>

I don't want that in the slightest. It's not difficult to log into separate tools. If I want them to integrate/trigger each other, that's what API's are for!Every vendor out there is flabbergasted when I tell them a 'single pane of glass' platform is a negative mark for us.Am I the problem? Am I taking crazy pills?EDIT:So I'm seeing a mixed bag on the responses. Everything from "teams are too dumb/busy/segregated to tie tools together so single pane is great" to "it's so they can sell you multiple subs" to my fave, "it's all marketting".At least I'm not crazy.submitted by/u/nerdyviking88[link][comments]</div>

‚ÄúFoundation‚Äù has captivated audiences with its intricate world-building, stunning visuals, bold storytelling, and compelling performances. Season 3 continues the epic chronicle of a band of exiles on their monumental journey to save humanity and rebuild civilization amid the fall of the Galactic Empire. 

Set 152 years after the events of Season 2, the Foundation has become increasingly established far beyond its humble beginnings while the Cleonic Dynasty‚Äôs Empire has dwindled. As both of these galactic powers forge an uneasy alliance, a threat to the entire galaxy appears in the fearsome form of a warlord known as ‚ÄúThe Mule‚Äù whose sights are set on ruling the universe by use of physical and military force, as well as mind control. It‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess who will win, who will lose, who will live, and who will die as Hari Seldon, Gaal Dornick, the Cleons, and Demerzel play a potentially deadly game of intergalactic chess.

<div id="summary-83" class="summary" style="display: none;">In the last couple of weeks i've been questioning myself about privacy, data, owning our things etc etc. I started doing a personal media server, and in the meantime i was thinking about the "gaming" side of things. After the big Microsoft layoffs my (already precarious) trust in the commonsense of the company is finally vanished. I have an Xbox Series S, but no desire to pay GamePass anymore, i have Windows 10 on my main rig (and 11 on my hp laptop) but even less desire to keep paying money to Microsoft for a lot of reason,So i searched and found Bazzite. In the back of my mind i have this question: with my rig, it will be worth to switch?CPU: Ryzen 2600xGPU: RX6600 Palit 8GBRam: 16gb DDR4 2600MHZSSD M.2 256gbTwo Caviar Blue 7200RPM 1TB Each.I play a lot of games, mainly single player, but sometimes (just sometimes) i play multiplayer games like Battlefield 1, older CoD, i want to buy Dune Awekening to play it with my best friend.Also i play a lot of older games. How is the compatibility side of bazzite? I can stay mostly safe? i have some experience with linux (ubuntu/Debian) and i probably used a lot of time fixing things on windows. I also use my pc for discord, browsing web. Should i switch?submitted by/u/MastropezzoOG[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-84" class="summary" style="display: none;">This isn‚Äôt your typical tech news roundup. In this video, we break down four massive stories from July that signal a major shift in how AI will shape our lives...from what we wear, to how we work, to the policies that govern it.

Here‚Äôs what happened:

üï∂Ô∏è Meta‚Äôs Superintelligence Lab
Mark Zuckerberg just announced a $110 billion push to bring AI into your everyday life. Starting with smart glasses that act like a personal assistant. With talent from OpenAI and Scale AI leading the charge, Meta is going all-in on AI.

üá∫üá∏ The U.S Government's ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs AI Action Plan‚Äù
The U.S. government released its most aggressive national AI strategy yet... focusing on speed, infrastructure, and ideology. From banning ‚Äúwoke AI‚Äù in federal use to prioritizing open-source models and deregulated development, this could shape AI‚Äôs trajectory for years.

ü§ñ ChatGPT Gets Agency
OpenAI gave ChatGPT the ability to take real-world actions: browse the web, send emails, even run code. This moves us into the era of agentic AI where AI doesn‚Äôt just answer your questions, it takes initiative.

üöó Tesla‚Äôs $16.5B Chip Deal with Samsung
Tesla signed a multi-billion dollar deal to manufacture custom AI chips with Samsung in Texas. These chips will power everything from Full Self-Driving to the Optimus robot, making Tesla not just a car company, but a full-stack AI player.</div>

<div id="summary-88" class="summary" style="display: none;">I have to say, it is really not funny in real life. Like holy F@#$2...He is a micromanager who is not a manager.he has the type of mindset that if you don't do it his way, you are doing it wrong.you could do 95% of the work, and he will come over adjust some cables, adjust a some monitors, take a picture of the setup, and in his head he basically did the work (even tho no one ask him to do so)Brother would start to update random confluence pages on Saturday and Sunday.he would be creeping on everyone's ticket in the ticket queue.He assigns tickets to you without asking or telling you if you have the time.He is the type of person that if you were to make a mistake, even tho you fixed it before it affected any users, he would tell the manager in order to get good boy points.Mind you, it is not like this guy is some IT god that would solve any issues or would get to the solution that no one could think of. His IT knowledge is on par with the rest of the team.Our manager is chill in the sense that as long as you do your tickets and work on your project, he is not on top of you, but on the other hand, this guy always tries to pseudo-manage people.I already confirmed this is not a me thing, and the other guys think the same thing.I'm not a confrontational type of person, but this guy is getting to me; I'm about to start shit. I just want to rant a bit because it is starting to frustrate me.Update: I forgot to add, based on his personality, I'm 100% sure that he is aiming to be the next in line for the manager position, so my fear is that anything I say or do could come back to bite me.submitted by/u/shiraco415[link][comments]</div>

1) the way a couple decides to split is ultimately up to them but i will say‚Ä¶. equity over equality‚Ä¶

if younger me (college student dating someone working full time) came up to me for advice i would tell her to absolutely tf NOT offer to split every single expense in the relationship

2) I think it‚Äôs ok to not offer to split on a first date. I obviously am always grateful and say ty!! if we end up getting dessert, i would be more than happy to grab that but no more performative purse searching and wallet grabbing!!!!

From the psychedelic swirl of the 60s to the slow, bass-heavy haze of modern hip hop, cannabis has quietly shaped the sonic landscape for over half a century. But how exactly does a plant influence production choices, vocal styles, even the tempo of entire genres?
This is the story of how weed became an invisible co-producer‚Äîfrom The Beatles to Snoop Dogg, from rock to trap‚Äîand how you can still hear its fingerprints in the music of today. It‚Äôs about altered states, slowed-down beats, and what creativity sounds like when your mind is somewhere else entirely.

<div id="summary-96" class="summary" style="display: none;">I played Battlefield 6 for 4 hours, and I‚Äôm honestly shocked by how good it is. Huge maps, tight gunplay, true squad coordination this feels like the Battlefield we've been waiting for. In this preview, I break down the gameplay, destruction, vehicles, and why I think this could finally be the comeback DICE needs.

EA invited me to join the event and covered my Uber to and from the Venue. I also ate a bunch of chips.

<div id="summary-111" class="summary" style="display: none;">The White House says it's working to bring back a program that encourages kids to have a more active lifestyle.

The Presidential Fitness Test for American schoolchildren was created back in 1966, and required kids to do sit-ups, push-ups, pull-ups and the one-mile run as part of a test in school gym classes.

The program changed during the Obama administration to focus more on individual health, but President Trump says it's time to bring it back.</div>

<div id="summary-113" class="summary" style="display: none;">Please, please, ignore the fact we're still running Access 97 for now please. I need a better way of getting this bullshit deployed silently.. Right now I have just about everything automated but this stupid thing I can't figure out. Takes a decent amount of time to get it to actually work on Windows 11.Finding documentation from before 2005 is a nightmare. I try to install "Microsoft Network Installation Wizard 2.1" and it just refuses to read any .LST or .STF files I throw at it saying its not from a "post-admin network image". What does that even mean?We're a small company and our dev team sucks. Our 15+ year DBA refuses to touch his precious ancient SQL servers to update the database to something more sane. No one else can do his job so here I am with this shit.6 years ago we hired a new CTO who blew millions of dollars on a rebuild of the entire application in Azure. It failed spectacularly, never worked at all, and now the whole company is scrambling to make sales and polish up this old turd of an application that runs on old SQL code and has our internal users still interacting with it on Access 97.submitted by/u/shmehh123[link][comments]</div>

We get it. You don't need to spell it out every time.But these are super popular games that most of us want to be able to play. By publicly expressing negative interest for such games on Linux you are harming us. If I was a market researcher scoping for Battlefield brand sentiment online, the message from the Linux gamers would be clear to me.Personally I am against invasive kernel space anti cheat solutions. Ideally I would like to see these games available on Linux without introducing such shitty measures into kernel.But most of us don't care about technicalities and just want to play the super popular game.submitted by/u/hardpenguin[link][comments]</div>

I had an intense day with it yesterday auto-mounting, reformatting Ntfs drives to Btrfs, suspicious cloned drives, but all of it has helped me step out of my comfort zone. I briefly considered switching back to Windows, but that thought disappeared when I researched other distros. I'm grateful I chose Bazzite instead of Mint or Pop because I prioritize gaming above all else, and those other options couldn't support me as well as this one has.I'm learning basic stuff like mentioned above, getting used and learning each day and after solving it gets to a satisfying level. I wanna thank everyone in the discord who helped me and the people from my first post who pushed me further to hug the penguin, right now I'm learning ujust terminal commands and bookmarked some tutorials because one day I might start to use the terminal more but time we'll see.Just today I've found alternatives for WinRAR or Office, and PeaZip with LibreOffice will do the work just fine. And thank god I didn't have a damn adobe subscription because Davinci is dope.submitted by/u/MysticalPeace[link][comments]</div>

Street of Dreams is an unfinished documentary film about the musician Tiny Tim and the 1979 Ghost Train fire at Luna Park Sydney, directed and produced by Australian artist Martin Sharp. The film first features Tiny Tim, showcasing footage of his record-setting, two-hour-and-seventeen-minute professional singing marathon at Luna Park Sydney in January 1979. It tells Tiny's life story, framed around the marathon performance footage, while highlighting his many eccentricities, religious convictions and others hangups as captured by Sharp's camera crews in both Australia and the United States.</div>

<p class="feed-title">Living Big In A Tiny House</p>
<button class="toggle-summary-btn" data-target="summary-142">...</button>
<div id="summary-142" class="summary" style="display: none;">Step inside this absolutely breathtaking modern tiny home set deep in the heart of the Australian rainforest. Here amongst the towering trees, tiny house magic has been created!  Built by superyacht captain Johny, this stunning rainforest tiny house is a personal paradise, designed as the ultimate retreat from the world. When he's not sailing the globe with the rich and famous, Johny returns to this peaceful sanctuary to surf, recharge, and reconnect with nature.

The home itself is a masterclass in tiny house design. With a single-level layout and a focus on openness and flow, it makes the most of its lush surroundings. Massive picture windows bring the forest inside, creating a seamless connection to the outdoors. The home feels expansive, calm, and deeply rooted in its environment.

Outside, the landscaping is equally as impressive. A generous deck expands the living area into the forest, while natural elements like boulders and large timber logs have been thoughtfully placed to ground the home in the landscape. It‚Äôs the perfect blend of modern design and raw, untamed nature.

This is a tiny home that you won't want to miss. We absolutely loved getting to visit this rainforest retreat and share Johny‚Äôs incredible story with you. We hope you enjoy the tour as much as we did.

<div id="summary-144" class="summary" style="display: none;">Nintendo is joining the crows and raising prices on old hardware. The base Switch is now estimated to cost $299 without a bundled game, and prices are going up across the board on older models and accessories. This comes after similar moves by Xbox and PlayStation in other territories but now we can add Nintendo‚Äôs case to the list :/

But today, these breakout stars have two choices: Tell the truth, or suffer the wrath of the Last Dab. Whoever eats the most wings, loses!

From Jake trying dishes from his "things I don't like list," to revealing embarrassing overshares, these two will either need to be honest, or go head-to-head with the Wings of Death. Can Jake rank his fellow podcast hosts from best to worst? Will Coco reveal which city she's least excited to perform for? Tune in to an all-new episode of Hot Ones Versus, and see who takes home the golden chicken wing trophy!

macOS 26 is now available in public beta, and after a month of testing, I‚Äôm ready to share my early review of macOS 26. From a complete redesign of Spotlight Search to the new Liquid Glass UI, this update feels like a big leap forward for Mac users.

‚úÖ Liquid Glass Design ‚Äì Translucent UI, customizable icons, and widgets
‚úÖ Spotlight Search Revamped ‚Äì New clipboard manager, file search, and macOS actions
‚úÖ Control Center Overhaul ‚Äì More like iOS/iPadOS, fully customizable
‚úÖ Phone App on Mac ‚Äì Make calls, screen calls, and manage voicemail
‚úÖ Reminders with Apple Intelligence ‚Äì Auto-categorize your tasks
‚úÖ Notes Markdown Export, Messages polls & typing indicators, Photos app updates
‚úÖ New Apps ‚Äì Games app, Journal app, and more
‚úÖ macOS 26 Stability ‚Äì Surprisingly solid for a beta

Apple‚Äôs making macOS feel more intelligent, integrated, and fluid than ever before. If you‚Äôre on the fence about installing the beta, I‚Äôll walk you through what works, what‚Äôs promising, and whether it‚Äôs stable enough for daily use.

üîî Don‚Äôt forget to subscribe and turn on notifications for more Apple beta coverage, including iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Sequoia, and more.

A kitchen is one of the most used spaces in any home, yet many kitchens are frustrating to use. Not because of how they look, but because the layout ignores how people actually cook, move, and socialise.
If you‚Äôre planning a kitchen remodel, renovation, or new build, these tips will help you design a kitchen that feels great to use :)

Although the data-wiping payload was misconfigured and didn‚Äôt execute, this breach exposes critical weaknesses in how trusted AI coding agents are distributed and secured. We break down what happened, how close we came to disaster, and why this is a wake-up call for every developer and security professional using AI tooling.

<div id="summary-181" class="summary" style="display: none;">According to a new poll from the health research group KFF, most adults in the U.S. don‚Äôt plan to get another COVID-19 shot this fall, and many are confused about new federal vaccine policies.

More than 1,200 adults were surveyed in July; 59% said they do not expect to get a COVID vaccine this fall. Older adults and Democrats were most likely to say they want another shot. Most Republicans say they don‚Äôt. Many parents also said they‚Äôre confused about whether the vaccines are still recommended for children.

The Trump administration has narrowed who‚Äôs eligible for the shots ‚Äî to people age 65 and older and younger people with other health problems. Federal officials recommend that parents should talk to their doctors before vaccinating their kids.</div>

Chief of War follows the epic and unprecedented telling of the unification and colonization of Hawai‚ÄòI in the late 18th century. Told from an indigenous perspective, Chief of War is a passion project for creators Jason Momoa and Thomas Pa‚Äôa Sibbett, who both share native Hawaiian heritage. The series features a predominantly Polynesian cast, led by Momoa alongside Luciane Buchanan, Temuera Morrison, Te Ao o Hinepehinga, Cliff Curtis, newcomer Kaina Makua, Moses Goods, Siua Ikale‚Äôo, Brandon Finn, James Udom, Mainei Kinimaka,Te Kohe Tuhaka and Benjamin Hoetjes. 
 
Chief of War is produced for Apple TV+ by FIFTH SEASON and Chernin Entertainment. Momoa directs the season finale and serves as executive producer. Doug Jung serves as showrunner and executive produces along with Sibbett, Peter Chernin, Jenno Topping, Tracey Cook and Brian Mendoza. Justin Chon directs the first two episodes and serves as executive producer. Anders Engstrom, Jim Rowe, Molly Allen, Francis Lawrence and Tim Van Patten also serve as executive producers. Grammy and Academy Award winning composer, Hans Zimmer wrote the theme music and co-produced the score for all nine episodes with composer, James Everingham, during his tenure with Bleeding Fingers Music, the multiple Emmy Award-winning and BAFTA-nominated composer collective co-founded by Zimmer in 2013.

<div id="summary-193" class="summary" style="display: none;">So this is happening. Our "trusted" integration partner just went radio silent three weeks before go-live, their project manager isn't returning calls, and I'm pretty sure they've moved on to easier clients. Cool. Cool cool cool.Context: I'm the IT director at a 200-bed hospital and we've been trying to replace our patient portal that literally still uses Flash. I know, I KNOW. Don't @ me. We got funding approved last year after our patient satisfaction scores tanked because people couldn't even log in to see their test results half the time.Found this vendor who promised seamless Epic integration, showed us these beautiful demos, the whole nine yards. Signed a contract in January, paid the first milestone payment, and everything seemed legit. Their team was responsive, they knew all the right FHIR buzzwords, even had references from other health systems.Then reality hit. The API calls started timing out randomly. Patient data was syncing but missing critical fields. Their "certified Epic integration" turned out to be a bunch of custom middleware that broke every time Epic pushed an update. When I asked about it, suddenly their developer who "built similar solutions for Mayo Clinic" was always in meetings.Last month they missed two major deadlines. When I finally got their PM on the phone, he basically admitted they'd never actually integrated with our version of Epic before and were "figuring it out as we go." That's when I started drinking at lunch.Three weeks ago: complete silence. Emails bouncing back. Phone goes straight to voicemail. I'm starting to think they just took our money and bailed.Meanwhile, my CEO is asking for status updates, our chief medical officer is making jokes about our "state-of-the-art 1990s technology," and I've got 50 physicians who were promised a working patient portal by next month.I'm sitting here at 11 PM googling "how to build Epic integration from scratch"...Anyone know a good therapist who specializes in IT trauma? Asking for a friend who is definitely me....submitted by/u/Tiny_Habit5745[link][comments]</div>

After this time, applications and devices will no longer be able to use Basic auth as an authentication method and must use OAuth when using SMTP AUTH to send email....The only remediation for this is to update your client or app to support OAuth, use a different client or app that supports OAuth, or use a different email solution such as High Volume Email or Azure Communication Services for Email.Primarily concerned about scan to email, as well as some various apps set up to do email reporting on my end.submitted by/u/01101110011O1111[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-201" class="summary" style="display: none;">The UK‚Äôs Online Safety Act just went into effect and VPN downloads are surging. ProtonVPN soared to #1 in the App Store after a staggering 1,400% increase in UK signups. In this video, I break down what‚Äôs happening, why people are turning to VPNs to protect their identity and bypass invasive age verification checks, and why I recommend ProtonVPN over less secure alternatives.

AI is helping people with life advice, but chats with mainstream models are not legally confidential. In this video, we explain Sam Altman‚Äôs comments on ChatGPT privacy, show Proton LUMO, and compare how a zero-access, open source, European-hosted assistant treats your data. We also cover Proton VPN, cash and crypto payments, and why UK age-verification rules are driving signups. If you care about privacy, encryption, and reducing data exposure, this walkthrough is for you.

<div id="summary-208" class="summary" style="display: none;">I'm scanning my brain inside a plane that‚Äôs about to be hurtling toward the ground. Here's why... 

It tests the effects of zero gravity on the brain, specifically, how well you can tell if stuff is upright or not! Which is really important for doing delicate experiments in space‚Ä¶ 

You put your head in this hole and watch a screen with this little line on it. Every time it changes, you have to hit a button to say whether you think it‚Äôs vertical or tilted. It‚Äôs surprisingly hard!

But this task is special...

Experiments like this are giving us valuable data for a future where humans are living long term in space.

If you want to see another experiment I did with a blood sucking sleeping bag‚Ä¶ subscribe!

<div id="summary-213" class="summary" style="display: none;">You don‚Äôt need to disappear off the grid to stay private online. But you do need a strategy.

In this video, we break down how to use social media without revealing your real identity. We‚Äôll walk through how to understand your threat model, avoid common mistakes, and build a pseudonymous identity that actually protects you.

Whether you're just trying to keep your boss out of your business or avoid serious profiling, we‚Äôll help you match your privacy tactics to your risk level, step by step.

00:00 Anonymity Should be BANNED
00:41 Storytime with Naomi
03:29 Overview
04:01 Understand Your Threat Model
05:25 Platform
06:24 Level 1 Basic Protections
08:51 Level 2 Advanced Protections
18:36 Level 3 Extreme Protections
19:23 The Good News

Achieving basic pseudonymity online is much easier than it sounds, and you absolutely have the power to reclaim it. Start from wherever you are. Every step you take makes a difference.

Happy August 1st! Crazy how fast the year‚Äôs flying by. üò≠

I wanted to share a few techy / desk setup‚Äìy things I do as a creator at the start of every month.

Realigning with myself (both as a solo creator and a creative) is how I stay grounded and ready for whatever‚Äôs next.

I hope this gives you ideas on how to build your own monthly rituals. Save this for later, or send it to someone who might need it. üíæ‚¨áÔ∏è

<div id="summary-227" class="summary" style="display: none;">"I combine my language with hip-hop so that, via hip-hop, my culture could continue living," says Eber Quisbert, a 40-year-old Bolivian rapper. Quisbert performs with his mentee and fellow Bolivian rapper, Carlos Orellana, 26, whose stage name is Andes Mc. The performers mix Spanish lyrics with Quechua and Aymara, two indigenous languages.

One of the songs they performed, "Jina Jina Mayma," tells the story of tensions between Bolivia's indigenous regions, blending their Quechua and Guarani languages. The title means "Let's go, everyone."

"We created a song like this because everyone just wants to live peacefully," Quisbert recalls. His lyrics aim to inspire unity and peace: "I'm from here, you're from there. Let's join hands, ready to move forward. Shout for liberty to the beat of equality. Leave behind prejudice, we are just one."</div>

<div id="summary-242" class="summary" style="display: none;">This episode features co-founders of fal, Burkay Gur and Gorkem Yurtseven.

fal is a generative media platform. They just raised their Series C round of $125M, which values them at a $1.5B valuation.

In 2020, during the COVID bubble in Palm Springs, two Turkish engineers ‚Äì one from Amazon, one from Coinbase ‚Äì started exploring startup ideas together. Starting with just image models when everyone said the market was too small, they stuck to their vision while competitors chased LLMs. They foresaw the video revolution coming. They obsessed over speed, becoming #1 on every benchmark.

From two Turkish immigrants to a billion-dollar AI unicorn ‚Äì this is their story.

In the first season of The Buccaneers, a group of fun-loving young American girls exploded into the tightly corseted London of the 1870s ‚Ä¶ setting hearts racing and kicking off an Anglo-American culture clash. Now the Buccaneers are no longer the invaders ‚Äî England is their home. In fact, they‚Äôre practically running the place. Nan is the Duchess of Tintagel, the most influential woman in the country. Conchita is Lady Brightlingsea, heroine to a wave of young American heiresses. And Jinny is on every front page, wanted for the kidnapping of her unborn child. All of the girls have been forced to grow up and now have to fight to be heard, as they wrestle with romance, lust, jealousy, births and deaths ‚Ä¶ themes consuming all women of any age, no matter what year it is. Last time we got a taste of England. This time we‚Äôre in for a veritable feast.

Written by series creator Katherine Jakeways, season two is directed by BAFTA Award winner William McGregor, DGA Award winner Rachel Leiterman, John Hardwick and Charlie Manton. Jakeways, BAFTA Award nominee Beth Willis and BAFTA Award winner Susanna White serve as executive producers. ‚ÄúThe Buccaneers‚Äù is produced for Apple TV+ by The Forge Entertainment, a Banijay UK company.

You move the email out of the spam box, back into inbox, and it goes back to spam a few seconds later he says.That's odd, our mail rule that sets internal to internal at SCL level -1 or whatever is a thing. Run a trace, delivered normally. KQL query - delivered normally. Not junk. Not ignore conversation feature. No block list. No mailbox rules. No Outlook plugins.I finally remote in because he's not on a job site. It's going to a folder literally called "spambox"We don't have anything that does that. Ask AI because I'm so done with this shit at this point.Day 3 of trying to figure this shit out.IT WAS HIS ****ING SAMSUNG MAIL APP ON HIS PHONE.Which we don't allow people to use because it doesn't work. We tell them to use the Outlook App, which is probably renamed Copilot AI Mail Extreme Edition X .NET Copilot Edition by now.FML I need a smoke break.

<div id="summary-283" class="summary" style="display: none;">Lo-fi girl's got nothing on this.

I built a tool that dynamically creates Infinite focus music that adapts to what's on your screen.

By combining a few locally-run Open-Source AI models (MagentaRT + InternVL3), it's trivial to have your own contextual, endless radio station.

Plus, I also go over some music model glitch token behavior; with absolutely terrifying results.

I unpack why this ‚Äúsafety‚Äù measure is a privacy nightmare.
We review the 59 GB Tea app breach that dumped women‚Äôs IDs, selfies and 1.1 million private messages online, plus the 15 billion credentials logged on Have I Been Pwned?. You‚Äôll see how third-party vendors such as Persona store UK citizens‚Äô data on US servers, creating cross-border exposure the moment a hacker breaks in.

That's why we are super excited to share this ingenious kitchen tool. The Cuisine Art Freeze Wand. It's basically meal prep but for homemade ice cream! You add the ingredients to the tubs ahead of time, great for fruit that's about to go bad or if you have an abundance of raspberries or black berries you can't pick quick enough. 

We have a COUPON CODE for 20% off a Freeze Wand until August 4th!

We bought a giant ‚Ç¨20 watermelon and turned it into the most refreshing naturally fizzy punch using wild fermentation!

We ended up with over 5 litres of juice, and that was with leftover chunks! After straining out the fibre, we poured it into a big glass jar and added:
Organic lemonsChopped organic appleA handful of fresh mint

These help kickstart the wild fermentation ‚Äî the natural yeasts on the fruit skins do all the magic. A few days later, we strained out the fruit, bottled it, and let it fizz up for another couple of days.

The result? A naturally carbonated, tangy-sweet, probiotic-rich watermelon punch!

<div id="summary-310" class="summary" style="display: none;">We've previously used CD Projekt RED's internal benchmarks to stack up Switch 2 against Steam Deck, but what about PlayStation 4, PS4 Pro and - of course - Xbox Series S. Comments from Virtuos satellite studio Black Shamrock suggest that Switch 2 features GPU power comparable with Series S and CPU power just a touch higher than PlayStation 4  - but to what extent does that tally with Cyberpunk 2077's outputs? It's just one game, running with different settings on each system, but nevertheless, the results are intriguing.

‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨ Video Overview ‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨
In this video, I'll walk you through my product design process, showcasing the key tools and apps at each stage. I'll demonstrate how I use sketching tools, Fusion 360 for 3D modeling, and Cinema 4D for rendering to create industrial-inspired designs. You'll also see how I leverage Figma for design documentation, Adobe Illustrator for packaging, and my complete setup for product photography and marketing videos.

At the end, you'll see the projects I've been working on over the past year: the Industrial Series. This includes the Encore Series 3 keyboard I designed with Mode and a new line of precision-machined pens with Inventery. Both products are an extension of my original ‚ÄúX-Ray Collection‚Äù, which uses translucent polycarbonate that reveals internal components, complemented by premium materials like brushed steel and copper.

<div id="summary-324" class="summary" style="display: none;">So today, one of our beloved domain controller decided to nosedive during Windows Update.A collegue informed me about it because he noticed that a backup plan stopped working for this server.I log in to investigate and am greeted by this gem:The paging file is too small for this operation to complete.Huh.Open Event Viewer - Event ID 2004 - Resource Exhaustion Detector shouting into the void. Turns out:MsSense.exe: 12.7GBMsMpEng.exe: 3.3GBupdater.exe: 1.6GBTotal: roughly more than three times what the box even had.Cool cool. So how much RAM does this DC have?4GB. FOUR. On a domain controller. Running Defender for Endpoint.Just when I think "surely the pagefile saved it," I run:Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_PageFileSettingAnd there it is:MaximumSize : 0 Name : D:\pagefile.sysZERO.Zero kilobytes of coping mechanism. On D:.Which isn‚Äôt even the system volume.It's like giving someone a thimble of water and telling them to run a marathon in July.Anyway, i rebooted it out of pure spite. It came back.

<div id="summary-332" class="summary" style="display: none;">In this week‚Äôs episode, we visit a 60 sqm HDB apartment in Tanjong Pagar, one of Singapore‚Äôs oldest neighbourhoods known for its hawker centre and historic shophouses. Originally built in the 1970s, the apartment has been reconfigured from a two-bedroom layout into a single-bedroom home with an open-plan living area. The design blends nostalgia with a minimalist approach, using natural textures such as grey stone flooring, warm wood cabinetry and limewashed walls to bring a renewed sense of life to the old unit.

<div id="summary-342" class="summary" style="display: none;">I recently built a small HTPC gaming build, and initially I tried to run it purely on the iGPU in my 2400G. While things ran OK, performance wasn't great, and I was getting constant flashes of a black screen when running at 4K HDR. After doing some research, I found that AMD on linux doesn't support HDMI 2.1, limiting the bandwidth and impacting 4K HDR with DTS audio passthrough, which is something I really want for media playback.Sooo, thinking AMD was the problem, I purchased a 3050. After rebasing I am up and running, and for a while things were going well at 4K HDR. However, audio passthrough still doesn't work properly, but at least the flashes to back screen have gone. Performance is also obviously a lot lot better.However, I started to notice some graphical glitches, and now any time I switch to desktop and then back to gaming mode, the screen glitches out and I have to hard reboot the machine. I found if I switch down to 1080p then it all works fine, but now I'm not getting 4K HDR which was a goal of this build for media consumption.So the way I see it, I've got 3 options.Stick with the 3050 and eitherAccept 1080p for now with the hope that a future update will fix the 4K HDR issues.Switch to WindowsReturn the 3050 and buy an RX 6400, which may or may not fix the flash to black screen issues (not sure if that's because of my weak iGPU or because of the lack of HMDI 2.1).Anyone having a similar experience to this? Other than this issue I've been loving bazzite, and it would be a real shame to have to switch to Windows, do we know if Nvidia driver fixes are in the pipeline for these issues?EDIT: An update for anyone that stumbles upon this. I tried the RX 6400 and while it all worked fine, the performance was too much of a downgrade so I returned it and I'll be sticking with the 3050.I had a breakthrough with audio passthrough by using Jellyfin Media Player. For whatever reason, I am able to get DTS passthrough working with that whereas Kodi couldn't do it.So for now, I have 4K HDR with DTS audio passthrough. I still get the odd graphical glitch when waking from sleep, or switching between desktop and gaming mode, but I will just live with it for now.submitted by/u/marktuk[link][comments]</div>

Architect Caroline Duncan's compact apartment is bright, flexible and full of custom DIY solutions and  smart storage. Thoughtful, inventive details include a customised Muji bench that provides both window seating and hidden storage, a modular felt sofa that easily converts into a bed, and a cat-friendly laundry nook that discreetly houses a litter box. The kitchen is a seamless blend of high and low, combining IKEA carcasses with bespoke birch plywood fronts and porcelain handles inherited from family. A full-height storage wall cleverly unifies the kitchen and wardrobe space while concealing a mirrored door to the bedroom. Subtle multifunctionality is scattered through-out the home: a recessed headboard niche doubles as a projector shelf, and a wall-mounted desk preserves the openness of the living space.

<div id="summary-348" class="summary" style="display: none;">I'm really wrestling with a directive from HR. They want to implement employee monitoring software for our hundreds of remote employees. The biggest headache is doing this without a massive backlash. I'm thinking about solutions that allow for silent, automated install. It's not only solid activity monitoring software and app and website tracking we need but also something easy to manage at scale for remote team management. Any thoughts on how to pull this off without causing a panic? Or pitfalls to avoid for workforce analytics at this scale? Thanks.submitted by/u/Expert-Economics-723[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-350" class="summary" style="display: none;">In the past there has been back and forth about this with people in smaller shops having one opinion and people in the large shops having another, and we definitely have our share of issues in the large enterprise, but I can say we do not have the following problems I see popping up here all the time.Secretary storing stuff in the network closed?Nope. Only authorized IT contacts have keys and policy forbids storage in network closets.Boss demands to have a list of everyone's passwords.Nope. Nobody can have anyone else's password by policy. Doing so would result in termination. No boss can override thisRandom desktop on a shelf in the data centerNope. Desktop computers are not allowed in the data center. Period.25 year old desktop with NT4 running the voicemail system in a closetNope. This would be a massive violation of the information security policy.Boss doesn't like MFA and forces you to turn it off for his accountNope. Information security policy requires everyone have MFA no matter who they are.A manager wants access to a former employee's email account and then starts sending email as them for months on endNope. If an employee leaves it requires multiple approvals including HR to get access to their email account, and only for long enough to copy the mail out and then it is closed down again. Old accounts can not be kept open indefinitely. Business process needs to be built around this because when people leave their accounts are absolutely deleted after a grace period.The finance lady insists she must have her own personal printer and the boss says to give it to herNope. There is no "finance lady" because finance is an entire department staffed by employees who have to operate as employees like everyone else and use the same equipment as everyone else. They can use secure release on the same printers as everyone else.It isn't all sunshine and roses by any means but we don't do a bunch of stupid nonsense that is just blatantly awful. There are no hubs under desks and servers in the bathroom. The microwave is not an IT responsibility. IT does not assemble furniture. We have a standard replacement cycle for our laptops every 3-4 years. Nobody has a gaming PC on their desk because they think they're special. Random non-technical executives do not have domain admin access just because they want it.We have a whole host of other issues, but at least we have none of these problems.submitted by/u/crankysysadmin[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-351" class="summary" style="display: none;">With the new BF6 trailer dropping, there has been a new wave of players interested in running EA games on Linux. Rather than just saying NO, it won't run, I decided it probably would help to explain the WHY behind it and what we can possibly do in the future for things of this nature.Why Do We Cry?EA has been slowly changing out their anticheats, starting with FIFA in 2023 (of course it was FIFA) to their own in-house client-side anticheat called EA Javelin[1]. As far as we know, it's in 14 games (as of 2024) including Battlefield 2042 (Season 6) and Madden 25. We also know that even if a game is single-player, if it has the possibility of multiplayer, EA is likely considering or already has migrated to EA Javelin. This, in turn, means all new multiplayer EA games will use this, including BF6. As this anticheat has, like most client-side anticheats, deep kernel binding, it makes it mostly unusable on Wine/Proton[2].What About VMs?Here's where things get interesting and where there is light at the end of the tunnel. Most of you who have one or multiple dedicated GPUs have probably at one point considered GPU passthrough, as in running Windows in a VM with dedicated hardware. This allows you to run kernel-level anticheats for the most part if you can "cloak" your VM, as in let the VM provide your actual hardware info to the anticheats rather than the default ones, but that doesn't work in all cases.The Layers of the OnionSo what are some of these layers exactly? Think of VM detection like peeling an onion (as is like 99% of security). Every layer you get through just reveals another one underneath, and by the end, you're probably crying, but fear not.Layer 1: The Obvious Stuff- This is your basic CPUID checks where the anticheat asks, "Hey CPU, are you running in a VM?" and your CPU responds, "Yep!" because it has this hypervisor bit set. Easy enough to hide with-cpu host,-hypervisor,kvm=off, but that's just the first layer.Layer 2: Hardware Fingerprinting- What is the name of the devices attached to your VM? Everything matters. Software can validate the name of the hardware, be it SSD, NICs, mouse/keyboard, or even the default drawing tablet libvirt passes over. If it's connected, a kernel-level application can see it. Your VM is telling Windows it's got a "QEMU HARDDISK" and "Bochs BIOS" and other dead giveaways. You can spoof all this SMBIOS stuff to make it look like a real ASUS motherboard with Samsung SSDs, but you better make sure EVERYTHING matches up since inconsistencies are a bigger giveaway than unspoofed information.Layer 3: Timing Checks- When your VM executes certain CPU instructions, it takes longer because of the virtualization overhead, i.e., it goes from the VM to the actual hardware and then back. The anticheat can time how long a CPUID instruction takes, for example, and if it's too slow, it knows something's up. Some of these timing differences are in the thousands of CPU cycles, making it super easy to detect.Layer 4: MSR and WMI Probing- EA Javelin specifically probes Model Specific Registers that behave differently in VMs. It also runs WMI queries that return empty or different results in virtualized environments compared to bare metal. For example, WMI queries for thermal sensors, power management, or hardware monitoring often return null in VMs but real data on physical systems. The anticheat cross-references these results with claimed hardware specs.Layer 5: ACPI Table Analysis and Exception Handling- EA Javelin examines ACPI tables for virtualization signatures and tests CPU exception handling behavior. VMs handle certain CPU exceptions differently than physical hardware, particularly around memory protection and privilege level transitions. It also checks for QEMU-specific ACPI entries and tests interrupt controller behavior that varies between hypervisors and real hardware.Why Most Games Work but EA Doesn'tThe thing is, these VM cloaking techniques actually work pretty well for most anticheats. EasyAntiCheat, BattlEye, and even Valorant's Vanguard can usually be fooled with proper SMBIOS spoofing and basic hypervisor hiding. But for some, like Valorant, it does become a cat and mouse game.EA Javelin is different because they're not just checking for virtualization, they're building behavioral profiles. While other anticheats might check 5-10 detection vectors, EA's system is checking dozens simultaneously and looking for patterns that match known hypervisor behavior. They've basically said, "We don't care if you're a legitimate user; if there's even a 1% chance you're in a VM, you're blocked."The Actual Solution: Type 1 Hypervisor PatchesWhere do we go from here, and why do I still think there's hope? The fundamental problem with our current approach is that we're usingType 2 hypervisors(KVM/QEMU running on top of Linux), which inherently have differences compared to baremetal systems. A commonly explored solution is moving toType 1 hypervisor implementationsspecifically designed for gaming.Xen with gaming patchesrepresents the most promising path forward. Type 1 hypervisors run directly on hardware without a host OS, eliminating many of the behavioral signatures that EA Javelin detects. The key is implementing gaming-specific patches that address the core detection vectors:Hardware interrupt controller emulationthat matches physical chipset behavior exactlyMSR passthroughfor specific registers that games probe while virtualizing othersACPI table injectionthat provides realistic hardware enumeration without QEMU signaturesMemory managementthat eliminates virtualization-specific page fault patternsTheQubes OS gaming patchesproject has been working on exactly this. A Xen-based system that provides near-native hardware access for gaming VMs while maintaining security isolation. Their approach involves creating hardware-specific profiles that match exact chipset behaviors rather than generic virtualization.ESXi gaming modificationsare another route some people are exploring. Since ESXi is already a Type 1 hypervisor, the detection surface is much smaller. The challenge is getting proper GPU passthrough and gaming-optimized scheduling, but some users report success with heavily modified ESXi configurations that present authentic hardware signatures.The real breakthrough will come when someone develops agaming-first hypervisorthat's designed from the ground up to be seemless. Think of it like a BIOS/UEFI that can boot multiple operating systems with complete hardware isolation but presents identical signatures to anticheats.Current Reality and What I'm Working OnRight now, yes, EA has basically won this round. My own VM setup that worked fine for everything else gets instantly detected by EA Javelin, and I've tried pretty much every technique out there. But I'm not giving up on this.I've been experimenting with Xen configurations and working on some patches that address specific detection vectors EA uses. The goal is to create a reference implementation that others can build on. It's slow going because you basically have to reverse engineer what EA is detecting and build countermeasures for each vector.The other approach I'm exploring is making a KVM patch for gaming, removing the fingerprints while keeping us on KVM and QEMU (which is the best long-term approach).What This Means for the CommunityFor now, if you want to play EA games, you're stuck with dual boot or GeForce Now. But I genuinely think the Type 1 hypervisor approach will eventually crack this nut. It's just going to take time and a lot of technical work.The broader Linux gaming community needs to start thinking beyond Wine/Proton for these edge cases. VM gaming with proper hardware passthrough is actually a better solution for many use cases and you get native Windows performance, full hardware access, as well as the ability to sandbox games away from your main system.I'll probably do a follow-up post if I make any breakthroughs with the Xen stuff, but for now, I just wanted to explain where we stand with EA and what the actual path forward looks like.[1]https://www.ea.com/news/introducing-ea-javelin-anticheat[2]https://www.ea.com/security/news/eaac-deep-diveEDIT: Removed EM-dash since people falsely assumed it was AI.submitted by/u/KstrlWorks[link][comments]</div>

‚ÄúFoundation‚Äù has captivated audiences with its intricate world-building, stunning visuals, bold storytelling, and compelling performances. Season 3 continues the epic chronicle of a band of exiles on their monumental journey to save humanity and rebuild civilization amid the fall of the Galactic Empire. 

Set 152 years after the events of Season 2, the Foundation has become increasingly established far beyond its humble beginnings while the Cleonic Dynasty‚Äôs Empire has dwindled. As both of these galactic powers forge an uneasy alliance, a threat to the entire galaxy appears in the fearsome form of a warlord known as ‚ÄúThe Mule‚Äù whose sights are set on ruling the universe by use of physical and military force, as well as mind control. It‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess who will win, who will lose, who will live, and who will die as Hari Seldon, Gaal Dornick, the Cleons, and Demerzel play a potentially deadly game of intergalactic chess.

<div id="summary-376" class="summary" style="display: none;">Hello everyone, It's been a while since I wanted to switch to Linux, and I feel like now is the perfect time to do it. I'm tired of the corporate ecosystem of Microsoft; I've mentioned this many times, yet I still find myself using Windows 11. The main activities I do on this PC are gaming and browsing, with very occasional editing. I want to transition to Linux because I have a full AMD system, but I'm concerned about potentially damaging it. I've heard multiple times that you can easily break almost any Linux distro if you don‚Äôt know certain terminal commands or if drivers get messed up, which is a significant deterrent for me. On top of that, Windows isn't doing me any favors by filling my system with bloatware. Four years ago, I tried using Linux Mint on a virtual machine but I found it quite confusing, especially when it came to using the terminal and managing packages. I‚Äôve never had a good resource or guide to learn the proper way to navigate it all. Additionally, I don‚Äôt want to dual boot with Windows because my SSD is rather old. To be honest, if I‚Äôm going to change something about this PC I might as well get a new one, but I don't want to spend any money right now, as I‚Äôd like to save for the future.I've been using Windows for almost 15 years, would do anything to switch right now because my motivation is bigger than ever, thanks.Also I'm not bothered about multiplayer games who have anti-cheats aganist Linux, I can easily say goodbye to CoD,Fortnite,Rocket League,CS2 since I've never played them actively at the beginning of the decade and I'm not interested right now.submitted by/u/MysticalPeace[link][comments]</div>

üéß About This Video
Vampire Weekend is one of the only bands in history to land three #1 albums on the Billboard 200‚Ä¶ without ever landing a single on the Hot 100. Not even A-Punk. In a music industry driven by hits, charts and TikTok virality, how did this band build a career entirely around albums? And what does that say about the way we measure success in music today?

I‚Äôm breaking down the paradox at the heart of Vampire Weekend‚Äôs career: from Contra to Modern Vampires to Only God Was Above Us and exploring how they‚Äôve stayed true to album-first artistry in a singles-first world.

<div id="summary-413" class="summary" style="display: none;">PlayStation fans are buying more Xbox games than anything else right now. According to new sales data, 4 of the top 5 best-selling PS5 games in Q2 2025 were Xbox-published titles ‚Äî including Minecraft, Grounded, and Forza Horizon 5. Meanwhile, rumors suggest Gears of War: E-Day and State of Decay 3 could be heading to PS5 too. Here's why Microsoft might be winning... even on PlayStation.

<div id="summary-415" class="summary" style="display: none;">Can a 2019 iMac become a legitimate Linux gaming machine? I installed the real SteamOS (the same OS found on the Steam Deck!) on this Apple hardware to find out. The gaming performance is pretty shocking! In this video, we take a used 2019 4K iMac with an Intel i5-7500 and a Radeon RX 560X and transform it into a dedicated gaming PC. We'll dive into the performance, what games work, the installation quirks, and whether this is a viable alternative to macOS or Windows for gaming on older Apple hardware. Is this the ultimate budget gaming PC you didn't know you had? 

üíª THE IMAC SPECS:
‚Ä¢ Model: 2019 Apple iMac (21.5-inch Retina 4K)
‚Ä¢ CPU: Intel Core i5-7500 @ 3.40GHz
‚Ä¢ GPU: AMD Radeon Pro 560X (4 GB VRAM)
‚Ä¢ RAM: [Your Amount of RAM, e.g., 16GB DDR4]
‚Ä¢ OS: SteamOS 3 (HoloISO Build)

<div id="summary-416" class="summary" style="display: none;">I really like Bazzite, but I struggled to get my LG OLED to work with it. The whole Linux not supporting HDMI 2.1 was a big gotcha I wasn't expecting. I wrote down my experience and what compromise I settled for. Hopefully it'll help others. I am pretty disappointed and on the fence about switching to Windows. (yuck)submitted by/u/mrblank_0[link][comments]</div>

Wuchang: Fallen Feathers doesn't break any new ground in the souls-like subgenre, but it doesn't get anything majorly wrong, either. If you're just looking for another one of these games, then you could do a lot worse than this one.

<div id="summary-419" class="summary" style="display: none;">North Korea just siphoned 17 million dollars through U-S remote jobs.

This video shows how U-S citizen Christina Chapman stockpiled laptops so DPRK workers could masquerade as Americans, win remote IT roles, and defraud 309 U-S companies, including many Fortune 500 firms, plus two abroad. Using 68 stolen identities, the ring moved millions before Chapman received a 102-month federal sentence.

This isn‚Äôt just a synthwave playlist ‚Äî it‚Äôs a feeling, a dimension, a trip into the sonic beyond.
üéπ Crafted by Frequency, these tracks hit deeper than nostalgia ‚Äî they breathe life into light and loneliness.

üõ∏ Let the synths guide you past stardust highways, through violet skies and electric dreams.
Every beat is a heartbeat of a dying star. Every melody ‚Äî a memory from a future that never happened.
üåå Feel the cosmic melancholy, the glow of the retro-future, and the gravity of emotion.

‚ú® This is where time dissolves and sound takes over. Play loud. Float away. Feel everything.

<div id="summary-432" class="summary" style="display: none;">This beautifully designed mouse helped me gain some MMR üí•

The AX5 Pro from @mchose_official pulls off a unique exoskeleton-inspired design with sacrificing comfort or performance. It‚Äôs a super lightweight gaming-focused mouse, with a smooth glide and a fast polling rate. To be honest, I‚Äôm just a sucker for its unique design. But I‚Äôm certain that gamers who want to climb fast are going to appreciate its ergonomic grip, and its responsive and light nature.

This must be my current favorite gaming mouse atm.

    "summary": "This off-grid homestead includes two handcrafted natural homes, a geodesic dome greenhouse built from local stone, a hand-dug stream, two natural swimming ponds, a bamboo maze, and a thriving permaculture garden and orchard with over 2,000 plants. It\u2019s a place where the home doesn\u2019t just shelter you\u2014it feeds you, cools and heats itself, filters your air, and invites you to slow down and live well.\n\nIt\u2019s the work of Vicente Nadal, a pioneer in natural building in his part of Spain. Tucked away in a quiet canyon near Alicante\u2014just beyond the bustle of the Mediterranean coast\u2014 he\u2019s blending ancient building knowledge with smart, low-tech innovation. Vicente believes the future lies in remembering what we've forgotten: using local materials, designing with the climate, and creating homes that actually give back.\n\nHere, nearly everything is made from stone, lime, and wood found on the land. The main house\u2014once a plain stucco structure\u2014is now full of organic curves and warmth, with thick walls that insulate and sculpted heated benches built into the design. The smaller home features a clever modular wall system that converts the open-plan studio into a two-bedroom layout in seconds. \n\nThe dome greenhouse is not only functional, but striking\u2014built by hand with lime mortar and wood for growing food year-round.\n\nVicente designs homes that are off-grid and health-enhancing. He uses lime plasters and paints inside and out, which naturally absorb CO\u2082, filter indoor air, and resist mold and bacteria. For cooling, a DIY \u201cCanadian Well\u201d system (AKA earth-coupled air cooling system) brings in fresh air from underground. For heating, thermal inertia stoves made with natural materials release warmth slowly over 24 hours using minimal wood\u2014heating both the space and the built-in seating with efficiency and beauty.\n\nThe land is shaped to support water and life: a meandering stream crosses under a stone Roman-style bridge, feeding two deep, natural ponds that help filter water and provide a habitat for frogs, dragonflies, and fish. There\u2019s even an outdoor limestone shower that, four years on, still looks like new\u2014thanks to limestone\u2019s natural resistance to stains and microbes.\n\nEven the finishing touches are rooted in local wisdom. Esparto blinds hang on the outside of windows, blocking harsh summer sun while letting in dappled light\u2014and on hot days, they can be misted to cool the air that enters the home. A treehouse built from leftover wood and salvaged windows, a mountain bike trail, and winding paths through the orchard show how joy, play, and function all coexist here. \n\nFor Vicente, this kind of building isn\u2019t a niche lifestyle\u2014it\u2019s a return to sanity. When you treat your home as an ecosystem, it becomes something that supports your health, grows your food, powers your comfort, and connects you to the land.\n\nhttps://www.rustega.es/\nUpdates about Vicente's builds  https://www.instagram.com/rustegabioconstruccion/\n\nOn *faircompanies: https://faircompanies.com/videos/building-private-eco-village-with-diy-stone-dome-and-full-ecosystem-%f0%9f%8c%bf%f0%9f%90%9f/",

    "summary": "Alex and Al started off as friends who decided to help each other build their own separate tiny homes, side by side.  But by the time their tiny home walls were framed, they had fallen in love.  So, they decided to build one of the tiny homes for them both to live in, and they finished and sold the other tiny house to help cover some of their expenses.  They\u2019ve been together for almost 6 years now and just recently got married!  They are still living in the tiny house together and say that it is even better than they hoped it would be!\n\nYou can follow and find out more about Alex's weaving at Alex Rooted here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/alexrooted\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@alexrooted\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@alexrooted\nhttps://www.alexrooted.com/\n\nTheir tiny house was built on a 24\u2019 long trailer, and it has 2\u2019 bump outs at each end, bringing the total length to 28\u2019.  The width is 8.5\u2019, and the height is 13.5\u2019.  The trailer they used is from Iron Eagle, and they chose it because the floor of the trailer is sunken down which provides some much needed vertical inches to make sure they had enough head room on the main floor and up in the loft.\n\nAlex and Al tried to use as many reclaimed and local materials as possible to reduce waste on the project, including using salvaged cedar shingles and planks for their siding, flooring from an old bowling alley, and locally milled wood.  For their interior walls, they used Wedi board and plastered it with venetian plaster for a stunning finish.\n\nStorage and space to cook were two major priorities with their design, so they have 38 large drawers to make sure they can keep the tiny space organized, and they have loads of counter space in the galley kitchen for preparing large meals and canning preserves.\n\nAlex and Al heat their tiny home with wood, and they made sure to get their wood stove WETT certified.  Another thing they did to help make sure they could get home insurance was to skirt their tiny home and remove the wheels.  By doing this, they were able to get mobile home insurance which was cheaper than tiny house insurance.\n\nTheir covered porch almost doubles their living space and was built using glass from secondhand sliding doors, and driftwood posts from a nearby beach.  The deck itself is built in sections so that it can be taken apart and moved if they have to find a new location.\n\nFinding parking for the tiny house was challenging and the couple is currently at their third location.  The first was an old covered mill where they began their build, but were evicted along with the other folks on the land.  The second was a nice forested site but it did not have any services so it was only used to complete their build.  Their third parking spot was found by putting up posters in the neighbourhoods where they wanted to live.  It has water, electricity, and septic, and they only had to bring in their own internet.  \n\nThe land rent is more affordable than renting an apartment or home in their area, and they also contribute to the landlords in other ways like chopping their firewood.  \n\nYou can follow and find out more about Alex's weaving at Alex Rooted here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/alexrooted\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@alexrooted\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@alexrooted\nhttps://www.alexrooted.com/\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nSTAY IN TOUCH!\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWebsite: www.exploringalternatives.ca\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/exploringalternativesblog\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/exploringalternatives/\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nCOMMENTS\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe want our channel and comments section to be an inclusive space where everyone feels welcome to watch and contribute.

Forced retirement isn\u2019t just a Boomer problem. It\u2019s a generational reality that you might face someday.

    "summary": "BEFORE STARTING (Please read)Some of the information on here may be incorrect or heavily dependent on specific situations and use cases. If you find anything that you think is useful to this guide, comment down below your suggestions and I will add it to this guide.But if you find anything in here that is incorrect, misleading or that does not work and etc, please comment down below so that I can further improve this guide.Please, help contribute to this guide if possible.Understanding some conceptsBefore starting, it is important that you understand some simple concepts for better understanding of your system, so that you can debug and figure out what you need and don't need to do.Desktop environment (DE):\"A desktop environment (DE) is an implementation of the desktop metaphor made of a bundle of programs, which share a common graphical user interface (GUI)\".Examples:KDE Plasma, XFCE, Hyprland, GNOME, Cinnamon and etc.Compositors: \"A compositor is a software which interacts with the window system as well as graphics in Linux to produce: Transparency in windows, Transition animations, Drop shadows around windows which give them a 3D effect, V sync: Waits for the display to update before updating the display\".Present modes:The presentation mode specifies when a frame is presented to the window. Can be discovered which one a game is using utilizing Mangohud, but, don't rely on it as it does not show precisely which presentation mode is being used a lot of the time. And also a common bug is that Mangohud does not update this field dynamically when gaming. So in some cases (like mine on THE FINALS) Mangohud will show FIFO but the game is actually running with Mailbox.Example:FIFO (V-Sync, FPS is locked to the monitor refresh rate), Mailbox (V-Sync but frame rate is not locked) and Immediate (No V-Sync, frame rate is not locked).Wayland:\"communication protocol that specifies the communication between a display server and its clients, as well as a C library implementation of that protocol.[9] A display server using the Wayland protocol is called a Wayland compositor, because it additionally performs the task of a compositing window manager\".X/X11/X Window system:\"The X Window System (X11, or simply X) is a windowing system for bitmap displays, common on Unix-like operating systems. X is an architecture-independent system for remote graphical user interfaces and input device capabilities. Each person using a networked terminal has the ability to interact with the display with any type of user input device\".DistrosA very common topic is which distro is better for X thing? In this case which distro is the best for gaming. Although there are some distros out there (Bazzite NobaraOS), the most popular as of now is CachyOS (which is not a gaming focused distro but it's the best in terms of gaming performance). But, you first need to understand that distros focused on gamingwill notoutperform in FPS a common distro such as Endeavour, Arch, Manjaro and etc by alargemargin. Distros such as CachyOS, Bazzite and NobaraOS do get better performance in most cases (+2 to 5%), and specially better 1% lows.However, these gaming focused distros are not focused/optimized on other type of workloads. So if you are just a regular user that also does gaming, going for something like EndeavourOS myself is a good choice as the difference is not that noticeable.But, it's not that CachyOS, Bazzite or NobaraOS will let you down if try to do something else. It's just that the focus a distro has generally helps with a \"out-of-the-box\" experience. Setting up EndeavourOS for gaming is more tedious than Bazzite or NobaraOS for example.Video driversThe most important part in all this guide is this. Using the correct driver and DE/Compositor combo is important because if you are using a NVIDIA card, then using X11 will deliver better performance and lower latency.Since this a very extensive topic, I'll just link below some useful links for you to get started/inform yourself.[Linux Graphics Drivers explained: AMD, NVIDIA, INTEL, Open Source and Proprietary]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW1CLcT83as&t=109s&pp=ygURbGludXggYW1kIGRyaXZlcnPSBwkJxwkBhyohjO8%3D[NVIDIA GPUs on Linux: What You Need to Know (Open vs closed drivers, module, GSP firmware, etc...)]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XMoADlten8&pp=ygUebnZpZGlhIGdwdSBkcml2ZXJzIGxpbnV4IGd1aWRlGuide to installing AMD/NVIDIA drivers:https://github.com/lutris/docs/blob/master/InstallingDrivers.mdStarting with the tweaks1. Disable your DE composition.Disabling composition can increase your FPS and lower latency, specially if you are in a NVIDIA card.Is not necessary on:AMD with Wayland (Only if you want lower latency, does not generally affect performance).Is not possible if:You are using KDE Plasma with Wayland.2. Use Gamescope.\"Gamescope is a micro-compositor from Valve that is used on the Steam Deck. Its goal is to provide an isolated compositor that is tailored towards gaming and supports many gaming-centric features such as:Spoofing resolutions.Up-scaling using AMD FidelityFX\u2122 Super Resolution or NVIDIA Image Scaling.Limiting frame rates.As a micro-compositor it is designed to run as a nested session on top of your existing desktop environment though it is also possible to use it as an embedded compositor as well\".How to use it?Set as launch options:gamescope(before %command% if you are on Steam)Arguments:-fForces exclusive full-screen.-w -hSets the window width (-w) and window height (-h)-rThe refresh rate--force-grab-cursor\"Creates\" a new cursor inside the window that stays locked inside the window unless Alt+Tab. Can decrease latency.--immediate-flipsForces the application to enable screen tearing.Usage example:gamescope -f -w 1920 -h 1080 -r 180 --force-grab-cursor --immediate-flips -- %command%(must include the--before %command%).3. Enable VRR (Variable Refresh Rate/Free-sync). Preferably, set it to \"Automatic\".4. DE/Window manager specific:KDE:Enable the \"Allow tearing on full-screen applications\" options in the display configuration;KDE:UseKWIN_DRM_NO_AMS=1environment variable;Sway:Useallow\\_tearing yeswithWLR_DRM_NO_MODIFIERS=1andWLR_DRM_NO_ATOMIC=1;Hyprland:UseDirect_Scanout=1.5. Set power mode to performance (Can be done both for the CPU and GPU with CoreCtrl).6. Environment variables:MESA_VK_WSI_PRESENT_MODE=immediateReduces latency;Forces Mesa\u2019s Vulkan WSI to use VK_PRESENT_MODE_IMMEDIATE regardless of application preference.KWIN_DRM_NO_AMS=1Reduces latency;Disables Kernel-mode \u201cadaptive modeset\u201d (AMS) scheduling in KWin/DRM Wayland backend. AMS might delay cursor updates and composite operations under GPU load.PROTON_USE_NTSYNC=1Can reduce latency (it did for me on THE FINALS);Enables native NTSync support in ProtonGE (Version 10-9, 10-10 enables it by default) synchronizes Vulkan & OpenGL submissions using Linux ntsync kernel module rather than Wine\u2019s own fsync/esync.PROTON_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1Can reduce latency and improves performance if you are on Wayland;Tells Proton to use the native winewayland.drv backend instead of XWayland/X11 so games run as pure Wayland clients.SDL_VIDEODRIVER=waylandCan reduce latency and improves performance if you are on Wayland;Forces SDL2 apps to use Wayland back-end instead of defaulting to X11/XWayland. Without it, SDL2 usually uses X11 even under Wayland unless compiled otherwise.7. Use a different kernel.If you are on CachyOS or other gaming focused distro then this is not necessary because those distros already have a custom modified kernel made specifically for gaming. But, if you are not using a gaming focused distro, then this is could prove to be helpful, as it can increase gaming performance and lower latency (measured by an average of 2ms). Such as my case that improved stability. But, do be aware that those kernels have custom schedulers and they can have other issues. So, do your testing to see if it fits you.The most common kernel for this use case is Linux-Zen, which is the one I'm using right now. It solved a problem I've been dealing with Arch that in certain cases, most primarily gaming, OS freezes can happen, making the whole OS become unresponsive and freeze under heavy workloads. In BeamNG I had a problem where the game would freeze with the OS for about a couple of minutes every time something new had to load. This went away when I used Linux-Zen, which decreases latency by an average of 2ms.8. Use a different DE.Desktop environments such as KDE have the highest latency. If you want a light-weight DE or just one that has lower input latency, use Hyprland or XFCE.A recent testing has been done regarding this topic:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UG8WeX_h1VGytK1Tz-56gETmzsM2CPiwXS9BoZ-1F60/edit?gid=0#gid=0(It's a more recent up to date version from this post made by the same person:https://www.reddit.com/r/linux\\_gaming/comments/1mejrig/linuxwayland\\_vs\\_win11\\_click\\_to\\_photon\\_latency/)9. Use LatencyFleX to use NVIDIA Reflex and AMD Anti Lag.\"Vendor agnostic latency reduction middle-ware. An alternative to NVIDIA Reflex\". LatencyFleX is a tool that can be used to enable the Reflex feature on NVIDIA and Anti Lag on AMD cards.THIS IS A USE AT YOUR OWN RISK TOOL, THIS CAN RESULT IN A GAME BAN ON GAMES SUCH AS CS2/THE FINALS/OVERWATCH ETC... (Although some players have reported not getting banned using this, still, be careful when using it).LatencyFleX GitHub:https://github.com/ishitatsuyuki/LatencyFleXVideo that explains in more depth and also includes a tutorial:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvmkSftYyP8&t=188s&pp=ygUSbGludXggbGF0ZW5jeSBmbGV410. General knowledge, common occurrences and possible fixes/causes.Higher frames reduces tearing and latency, making the experience more smooth and responsive (Higher frames with no V-Sync feels more responsive than higher frames with V-Sync).High GPU usage can cause more input latency. So playing at 99% GPU usage at 220 FPS has more latency than 90% GPU usage at 200 FPS for example (If you use Reflex or Anti Lag then this is not a issue).Input lag,can be caused by:Your compositor forces V-Sync;V-Sync turned on in-game;Game/Proton/Wine incompatibility;Border-less or windowed mode have higher latency than exclusive full-screen (This is not true on Wayland as far knowledge goes, but setting a game to full-screen will enable the \"Allow tearing on full-screen applications\" on KDE to take effect.;Check if your compositor is compositing in general or if only is compositing in full-screen applications.Useful for solving this problem:Environment variables;Disabling V-Sync;\"Allow tearing on full-screen applications\" should be enabled on KDE;Gamescope with forced full-screen (-f and --immediate-flips);Use NTSYNC with ProtonGE;Force your compositor to not use V-Sync (if possible);VRR (Variable refresh rate/Free-sync) enabled;Use X11 instead of Wayland, specially on NVIDIA.---Stutters,can be caused by (assuming your hardware is not the problem):Shader compilation;Game incompatibility with Linux;Proton version.Useful for solving this problem:Try dxvk-gplasync:https://gitlab.com/Ph42oN/dxvk-gplasync;Use Gamemode;Disable overlays (Generally do not have any impact, so test it out to se if it helps);Set your power profile to performance (CoreCtrl can be used for this);Different kernel;Older or wrong drivers, specially video drivers if this issue is global.?.(Not related to latency but useful):Disable mouse acceleration.Use Feral Gamemode.(Some of the texts and sources used for this guide are directly from sites, videos and wikis, but I can not link them here due to Reddit spam filters)submitted by/u/SadBrazilian7[link][comments]",

    "summary": "Morning folks,I've been using Bazzite for a few weeks now, quite happy with the general user experience. I've noticed however that there are a lot of things which I want to do as a developer that are major friction points. Today's the latest example: I want to install aG13 driverso I can use my keypad when playing games, and the process is a series of reboots to install libraries through rpm-ostree. I need libusb1-devel and java-latest-openjdk.x86_64 (one reboot). Next I need the gtk library (second reboot, which I don't want to do yet). As a programmer, I've noticed a few other libraries I've wanted are missing now and then, and I've just given up on doing work on this computer and working on a more permissive VM instead.Am I missing something? Is the intention to just build everything from source now if I'm doing development and ignore the conveniences of installing precompiled libraries? Or am I really supposed to reboot my computer half a dozen to a dozen times to install a chain of libraries as I encounter the next layer of missing libraries?Addendum: Lots of solid opinions and feedback. In particular the vibe I was getting from distrobox is \"it's Podman masquerading as WSL\", but I can see it's not quite that simple. I was able to make the driver compile in a distrobox and it functions outside of it as a user space program, so good to know on that front. I'm not familiar with packaging things for homebrew so I guess I have a new thing to look into.submitted by/u/Feynt[link][comments]",

But the problem comes if I alt-tab, which I need to do in order to set up stuff like Discord streaming or Teamspeak for radio mods.The first time it's fine, but after the 2nd or so it really breaks everything. Plasma just dies and I am left with a black screen even after I exit the game. Plasma gives me this weird readback if I try to fiddle with it.The only way I have found to fix it was to open the Plasma Renderer using the Terminal and \"kcmshell6 kcm_qtquicksettings\" and setting thr 'Rendering Backend' to 'Automatic'.The only problem is that when I play Arma again, the same thing happens. I look at the Rendering Backend again and somehow it's set to 'Software'. And it just breaks until I set it back to AutomaticWhat's a permanent Fix? How can I prevent this from happening?submitted by/u/Blockhead_Gundam[link][comments]",

It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess who will win, who will lose, who will live, and who will die as Hari Seldon, Gaal Dornick, the Cleons, and Demerzel play a potentially deadly game of intergalactic chess. \n\nSubscribe to Apple TV\u2019s YouTube channel: https://apple.co/AppleTVYouTube\n\nFollow Apple TV:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleTV\nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@AppleTV\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/AppleTV\nX: https://X.com/AppleTV\nGiphy: https://giphy.com/AppleTV\n\nFollow Apple Films:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleFilms\nX: https://X.com/AppleFilms\n\nMore from Apple TV: https://apple.co/32qgOEJ\n\nApple TV+ is a streaming service with original stories from the most creative minds in TV and film.

I have an Xbox Series S, but no desire to pay GamePass anymore, i have Windows 10 on my main rig (and 11 on my hp laptop) but even less desire to keep paying money to Microsoft for a lot of reason,So i searched and found Bazzite.

How is the compatibility side of bazzite? I can stay mostly safe? i have some experience with linux (ubuntu/Debian) and i probably used a lot of time fixing things on windows.

From banning \u201cwoke AI\u201d in federal use to prioritizing open-source models and deregulated development, this could shape AI\u2019s trajectory for years.\n\n\ud83e\udd16 ChatGPT Gets Agency\nOpenAI gave ChatGPT the ability to take real-world actions: browse the web, send emails, even run code. This moves us into the era of agentic AI where AI doesn\u2019t just answer your questions, it takes initiative.\n\n\ud83d\ude97 Tesla\u2019s $16.5B Chip Deal with Samsung\nTesla signed a multi-billion dollar deal to manufacture custom AI chips with Samsung in Texas.

His IT knowledge is on par with the rest of the team.Our manager is chill in the sense that as long as you do your tickets and work on your project, he is not on top of you, but on the other hand, this guy always tries to pseudo-manage people.I already confirmed this is not a me thing, and the other guys think the same thing.I'm not a confrontational type of person, but this guy is getting to me; I'm about to start shit. I just want to rant a bit because it is starting to frustrate me.Update: I forgot to add, based on his personality, I'm 100% sure that he is aiming to be the next in line for the manager position, so my fear is that anything I say or do could come back to bite me.submitted by/u/shiraco415[link][comments]",

I try to install \"Microsoft Network Installation Wizard 2.1\" and it just refuses to read any .LST or .STF files I throw at it saying its not from a \"post-admin network image\".

No one else can do his job so here I am with this shit.6 years ago we hired a new CTO who blew millions of dollars on a rebuild of the entire application in Azure. It failed spectacularly, never worked at all, and now the whole company is scrambling to make sales and polish up this old turd of an application that runs on old SQL code and has our internal users still interacting with it on Access 97.submitted by/u/shmehh123[link][comments]",

I had an intense day with it yesterday auto-mounting, reformatting Ntfs drives to Btrfs, suspicious cloned drives, but all of it has helped me step out of my comfort zone. I briefly considered switching back to Windows, but that thought disappeared when I researched other distros. I'm grateful I chose Bazzite instead of Mint or Pop because I prioritize gaming above all else, and those other options couldn't support me as well as this one has.I'm learning basic stuff like mentioned above, getting used and learning each day and after solving it gets to a satisfying level. I wanna thank everyone in the discord who helped me and the people from my first post who pushed me further to hug the penguin, right now I'm learning ujust terminal commands and bookmarked some tutorials because one day I might start to use the terminal more but time we'll see.Just today I've found alternatives for WinRAR or Office, and PeaZip with LibreOffice will do the work just fine.

    "summary": "Step inside this absolutely breathtaking modern tiny home set deep in the heart of the Australian rainforest. Here amongst the towering trees, tiny house magic has been created!  Built by superyacht captain Johny, this stunning rainforest tiny house is a personal paradise, designed as the ultimate retreat from the world. When he's not sailing the globe with the rich and famous, Johny returns to this peaceful sanctuary to surf, recharge, and reconnect with nature.\n\nThe home itself is a masterclass in tiny house design. With a single-level layout and a focus on openness and flow, it makes the most of its lush surroundings. Massive picture windows bring the forest inside, creating a seamless connection to the outdoors. The home feels expansive, calm, and deeply rooted in its environment.\n\nOutside, the landscaping is equally as impressive. A generous deck expands the living area into the forest, while natural elements like boulders and large timber logs have been thoughtfully placed to ground the home in the landscape. It\u2019s the perfect blend of modern design and raw, untamed nature.\n\nThis is a tiny home that you won't want to miss. We absolutely loved getting to visit this rainforest retreat and share Johny\u2019s incredible story with you. We hope you enjoy the tour as much as we did.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f If you enjoy our show and would like to help support our work, please consider supporting us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/livingbig\n\n\ud83c\udf1f Our Socials and Links: https://linktr.ee/livingbig\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Find out more about this tiny house and others on our website: https://www.livingbiginatinyhouse.com/\n\nPlease subscribe for more videos on tiny houses, architecture, DIY, design, and sustainable, off-grid living.\n\nPresented and Produced by: Bryce Langston\nCamera: Rasa Pescud & Bryce Langston\nEditing:  Sarah Binder & Rasa Pescud\n\nAdditional video supplied by Johny\n\nTitle music in this video by Bryce Langston: http://www.youtube.com/brycelangston\n\n'Living Big in a Tiny House' \u00a9 2025 Zyia Pictures Ltd\n\n#tinyhouse #tinyhousetour #rainforest #tinyhouseparadise #tinyhome #innature  #homedesign",

Our \"trusted\" integration partner just went radio silent three weeks before go-live, their project manager isn't returning calls, and I'm pretty sure they've moved on to easier clients. Cool. Cool cool cool.Context: I'm the IT director at a 200-bed hospital and we've been trying to replace our patient portal that literally still uses Flash. I know, I KNOW. Don't @ me. We got funding approved last year after our patient satisfaction scores tanked because people couldn't even log in to see their test results half the time.Found this vendor who promised seamless Epic integration, showed us these beautiful demos, the whole nine yards. Signed a contract in January, paid the first milestone payment, and everything seemed legit. Their team was responsive, they knew all the right FHIR buzzwords, even had references from other health systems.Then reality hit. The API calls started timing out randomly. Patient data was syncing but missing critical fields. Their \"certified Epic integration\" turned out to be a bunch of custom middleware that broke every time Epic pushed an update. When I asked about it, suddenly their developer who \"built similar solutions for Mayo Clinic\" was always in meetings.Last month they missed two major deadlines. When I finally got their PM on the phone, he basically admitted they'd never actually integrated with our version of Epic before and were \"figuring it out as we go.\" That's when I started drinking at lunch.Three weeks ago: complete silence. Emails bouncing back. Phone goes straight to voicemail. I'm starting to think they just took our money and bailed.Meanwhile, my CEO is asking for status updates, our chief medical officer is making jokes about our \"state-of-the-art 1990s technology,\" and I've got 50 physicians who were promised a working patient portal by next month.I'm sitting here at 11 PM googling \"how to build Epic integration from scratch\"...Anyone know a good therapist who specializes in IT trauma?

    "summary": "I recently built a small HTPC gaming build, and initially I tried to run it purely on the iGPU in my 2400G. While things ran OK, performance wasn't great, and I was getting constant flashes of a black screen when running at 4K HDR. After doing some research, I found that AMD on linux doesn't support HDMI 2.1, limiting the bandwidth and impacting 4K HDR with DTS audio passthrough, which is something I really want for media playback.Sooo, thinking AMD was the problem, I purchased a 3050. After rebasing I am up and running, and for a while things were going well at 4K HDR. However, audio passthrough still doesn't work properly, but at least the flashes to back screen have gone. Performance is also obviously a lot lot better.However, I started to notice some graphical glitches, and now any time I switch to desktop and then back to gaming mode, the screen glitches out and I have to hard reboot the machine. I found if I switch down to 1080p then it all works fine, but now I'm not getting 4K HDR which was a goal of this build for media consumption.So the way I see it, I've got 3 options.Stick with the 3050 and eitherAccept 1080p for now with the hope that a future update will fix the 4K HDR issues.Switch to WindowsReturn the 3050 and buy an RX 6400, which may or may not fix the flash to black screen issues (not sure if that's because of my weak iGPU or because of the lack of HMDI 2.1).Anyone having a similar experience to this? Other than this issue I've been loving bazzite, and it would be a real shame to have to switch to Windows, do we know if Nvidia driver fixes are in the pipeline for these issues?EDIT: An update for anyone that stumbles upon this. I tried the RX 6400 and while it all worked fine, the performance was too much of a downgrade so I returned it and I'll be sticking with the 3050.I had a breakthrough with audio passthrough by using Jellyfin Media Player. For whatever reason, I am able to get DTS passthrough working with that whereas Kodi couldn't do it.So for now, I have 4K HDR with DTS audio passthrough. I still get the odd graphical glitch when waking from sleep, or switching between desktop and gaming mode, but I will just live with it for now.submitted by/u/marktuk[link][comments]",

    "summary": "With the new BF6 trailer dropping, there has been a new wave of players interested in running EA games on Linux. Rather than just saying NO, it won't run, I decided it probably would help to explain the WHY behind it and what we can possibly do in the future for things of this nature.Why Do We Cry?EA has been slowly changing out their anticheats, starting with FIFA in 2023 (of course it was FIFA) to their own in-house client-side anticheat called EA Javelin[1]. As far as we know, it's in 14 games (as of 2024) including Battlefield 2042 (Season 6) and Madden 25. We also know that even if a game is single-player, if it has the possibility of multiplayer, EA is likely considering or already has migrated to EA Javelin. This, in turn, means all new multiplayer EA games will use this, including BF6. As this anticheat has, like most client-side anticheats, deep kernel binding, it makes it mostly unusable on Wine/Proton[2].What About VMs?Here's where things get interesting and where there is light at the end of the tunnel. Most of you who have one or multiple dedicated GPUs have probably at one point considered GPU passthrough, as in running Windows in a VM with dedicated hardware. This allows you to run kernel-level anticheats for the most part if you can \"cloak\" your VM, as in let the VM provide your actual hardware info to the anticheats rather than the default ones, but that doesn't work in all cases.The Layers of the OnionSo what are some of these layers exactly? Think of VM detection like peeling an onion (as is like 99% of security). Every layer you get through just reveals another one underneath, and by the end, you're probably crying, but fear not.Layer 1: The Obvious Stuff- This is your basic CPUID checks where the anticheat asks, \"Hey CPU, are you running in a VM?\" and your CPU responds, \"Yep!\" because it has this hypervisor bit set. Easy enough to hide with-cpu host,-hypervisor,kvm=off, but that's just the first layer.Layer 2: Hardware Fingerprinting- What is the name of the devices attached to your VM? Everything matters. Software can validate the name of the hardware, be it SSD, NICs, mouse/keyboard, or even the default drawing tablet libvirt passes over. If it's connected, a kernel-level application can see it. Your VM is telling Windows it's got a \"QEMU HARDDISK\" and \"Bochs BIOS\" and other dead giveaways. You can spoof all this SMBIOS stuff to make it look like a real ASUS motherboard with Samsung SSDs, but you better make sure EVERYTHING matches up since inconsistencies are a bigger giveaway than unspoofed information.Layer 3: Timing Checks- When your VM executes certain CPU instructions, it takes longer because of the virtualization overhead, i.e., it goes from the VM to the actual hardware and then back. The anticheat can time how long a CPUID instruction takes, for example, and if it's too slow, it knows something's up. Some of these timing differences are in the thousands of CPU cycles, making it super easy to detect.Layer 4: MSR and WMI Probing- EA Javelin specifically probes Model Specific Registers that behave differently in VMs. It also runs WMI queries that return empty or different results in virtualized environments compared to bare metal. For example, WMI queries for thermal sensors, power management, or hardware monitoring often return null in VMs but real data on physical systems. The anticheat cross-references these results with claimed hardware specs.Layer 5: ACPI Table Analysis and Exception Handling- EA Javelin examines ACPI tables for virtualization signatures and tests CPU exception handling behavior. VMs handle certain CPU exceptions differently than physical hardware, particularly around memory protection and privilege level transitions. It also checks for QEMU-specific ACPI entries and tests interrupt controller behavior that varies between hypervisors and real hardware.Why Most Games Work but EA Doesn'tThe thing is, these VM cloaking techniques actually work pretty well for most anticheats. EasyAntiCheat, BattlEye, and even Valorant's Vanguard can usually be fooled with proper SMBIOS spoofing and basic hypervisor hiding. But for some, like Valorant, it does become a cat and mouse game.EA Javelin is different because they're not just checking for virtualization, they're building behavioral profiles. While other anticheats might check 5-10 detection vectors, EA's system is checking dozens simultaneously and looking for patterns that match known hypervisor behavior. They've basically said, \"We don't care if you're a legitimate user; if there's even a 1% chance you're in a VM, you're blocked.\"The Actual Solution: Type 1 Hypervisor PatchesWhere do we go from here, and why do I still think there's hope? The fundamental problem with our current approach is that we're usingType 2 hypervisors(KVM/QEMU running on top of Linux), which inherently have differences compared to baremetal systems. A commonly explored solution is moving toType 1 hypervisor implementationsspecifically designed for gaming.Xen with gaming patchesrepresents the most promising path forward. Type 1 hypervisors run directly on hardware without a host OS, eliminating many of the behavioral signatures that EA Javelin detects. The key is implementing gaming-specific patches that address the core detection vectors:Hardware interrupt controller emulationthat matches physical chipset behavior exactlyMSR passthroughfor specific registers that games probe while virtualizing othersACPI table injectionthat provides realistic hardware enumeration without QEMU signaturesMemory managementthat eliminates virtualization-specific page fault patternsTheQubes OS gaming patchesproject has been working on exactly this. A Xen-based system that provides near-native hardware access for gaming VMs while maintaining security isolation. Their approach involves creating hardware-specific profiles that match exact chipset behaviors rather than generic virtualization.ESXi gaming modificationsare another route some people are exploring. Since ESXi is already a Type 1 hypervisor, the detection surface is much smaller. The challenge is getting proper GPU passthrough and gaming-optimized scheduling, but some users report success with heavily modified ESXi configurations that present authentic hardware signatures.The real breakthrough will come when someone develops agaming-first hypervisorthat's designed from the ground up to be seemless. Think of it like a BIOS/UEFI that can boot multiple operating systems with complete hardware isolation but presents identical signatures to anticheats.Current Reality and What I'm Working OnRight now, yes, EA has basically won this round. My own VM setup that worked fine for everything else gets instantly detected by EA Javelin, and I've tried pretty much every technique out there. But I'm not giving up on this.I've been experimenting with Xen configurations and working on some patches that address specific detection vectors EA uses. The goal is to create a reference implementation that others can build on. It's slow going because you basically have to reverse engineer what EA is detecting and build countermeasures for each vector.The other approach I'm exploring is making a KVM patch for gaming, removing the fingerprints while keeping us on KVM and QEMU (which is the best long-term approach).What This Means for the CommunityFor now, if you want to play EA games, you're stuck with dual boot or GeForce Now. But I genuinely think the Type 1 hypervisor approach will eventually crack this nut. It's just going to take time and a lot of technical work.The broader Linux gaming community needs to start thinking beyond Wine/Proton for these edge cases. VM gaming with proper hardware passthrough is actually a better solution for many use cases and you get native Windows performance, full hardware access, as well as the ability to sandbox games away from your main system.I'll probably do a follow-up post if I make any breakthroughs with the Xen stuff, but for now, I just wanted to explain where we stand with EA and what the actual path forward looks like.[1]https://www.ea.com/news/introducing-ea-javelin-anticheat[2]https://www.ea.com/security/news/eaac-deep-diveEDIT: Removed EM-dash since people falsely assumed it was AI.submitted by/u/KstrlWorks[link][comments]",

    "summary": "Hello everyone, It's been a while since I wanted to switch to Linux, and I feel like now is the perfect time to do it. I'm tired of the corporate ecosystem of Microsoft; I've mentioned this many times, yet I still find myself using Windows 11. The main activities I do on this PC are gaming and browsing, with very occasional editing. I want to transition to Linux because I have a full AMD system, but I'm concerned about potentially damaging it. I've heard multiple times that you can easily break almost any Linux distro if you don\u2019t know certain terminal commands or if drivers get messed up, which is a significant deterrent for me. On top of that, Windows isn't doing me any favors by filling my system with bloatware. Four years ago, I tried using Linux Mint on a virtual machine but I found it quite confusing, especially when it came to using the terminal and managing packages. I\u2019ve never had a good resource or guide to learn the proper way to navigate it all. Additionally, I don\u2019t want to dual boot with Windows because my SSD is rather old. To be honest, if I\u2019m going to change something about this PC I might as well get a new one, but I don't want to spend any money right now, as I\u2019d like to save for the future.I've been using Windows for almost 15 years, would do anything to switch right now because my motivation is bigger than ever, thanks.Also I'm not bothered about multiplayer games who have anti-cheats aganist Linux, I can easily say goodbye to CoD,Fortnite,Rocket League,CS2 since I've never played them actively at the beginning of the decade and I'm not interested right now.submitted by/u/MysticalPeace[link][comments]",
