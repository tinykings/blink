<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/6opJeEyn5f4" target="_blank">Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong. #Invasion Season 3 — August 22</a></h2>

<div id="summary-1" class="summary" style="display: none;">Some answers come at a cost. Invasion Season 3 premieres August 22 on Apple TV+ https://apple.co/_Invasion 

Invasion follows an alien invasion through different perspectives around the world.  In season three, those perspectives collide for the first time, as the series’ main characters are brought together to work as a team on a critical mission to infiltrate the alien mothership. The ultimate apex aliens have finally emerged, rapidly spreading their deadly tendrils across our planet. It will take all our heroes working together, using all their experience and expertise, to save our species. New relationships are formed, old relationship are challenged and even shattered, as our international cast of characters must become a team before it’s too late. 

The third season of Invasion stars returning cast members Golshifteh Farahani, Shioli Kutsuna, Shamier Anderson, India Brown, Shane Zaza, Enver Gjokaj, and introduces new series regular Erika Alexander.

Invasion is created by Kinberg and Weil, who also serve as executive producers alongside Audrey Chon, David Witz, Alik Sakharov, Dan Dietz, Katie O’Connell Marsh and Nick Nantell.

Brave just raised the privacy bar. Its latest update blocks Microsoft’s Recall
feature from screenshotting Brave windows by default. In this step-by-step guide I:
• Test Brave with EFF’s Cover Your Tracks
• Compare Brave vs Chrome, Tor, Firefox
• Show a clean Brave setup (dark mode, shields, Reader, search tweaks)
• Explain why ProtonVPN (1 400 % UK sign-up spike) is still my only VPN pick.

So that's exactly why I think that we shouldn't be grandstanding on this as politicians,” the former presidential candidate told NPR Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep. “We should be empowering communities and organizations and schools to make the right decisions.”

<div id="summary-11" class="summary" style="display: none;">Lo-fi girl's got nothing on this.

I built a tool that dynamically creates Infinite focus music that adapts to what's on your screen.

By combining a few locally-run Open-Source AI models (MagentaRT + InternVL3), it's trivial to have your own contextual, endless radio station.

Plus, I also go over some music model glitch token behavior; with absolutely terrifying results.

<div id="summary-17" class="summary" style="display: none;">Governments are pushing age verification laws that force you to upload a passport, driver’s-licence selfie or credit-card scan just to access platforms like Reddit, X (Twitter), BlueSky or Xbox Live. I unpack why this “safety” measure is a privacy nightmare.
We review the 59 GB Tea app breach that dumped women’s IDs, selfies and 1.1 million private messages online, plus the 15 billion credentials logged on Have I Been Pwned?. You’ll see how third-party vendors such as Persona store UK citizens’ data on US servers, creating cross-border exposure the moment a hacker breaks in.

That's why we are super excited to share this ingenious kitchen tool. The Cuisine Art Freeze Wand. It's basically meal prep but for homemade ice cream! You add the ingredients to the tubs ahead of time, great for fruit that's about to go bad or if you have an abundance of raspberries or black berries you can't pick quick enough.

<div id="summary-26" class="summary" style="display: none;">Fermented Watermelon Punch! 🍉
We bought a giant €20 watermelon and turned it into the most refreshing naturally fizzy punch using wild fermentation!

We ended up with over 5 litres of juice, and that was with leftover chunks! After straining out the fibre, we poured it into a big glass jar and added:
Organic lemonsChopped organic appleA handful of fresh mint

These help kickstart the wild fermentation — the natural yeasts on the fruit skins do all the magic. A few days later, we strained out the fruit, bottled it, and let it fizz up for another couple of days.

The result? A naturally carbonated, tangy-sweet, probiotic-rich watermelon punch!

<div id="summary-33" class="summary" style="display: none;">Microsoft just revealed that Xbox Game Pass generated nearly $5 billion in revenue during fiscal year 2025, confirming one of the most debated topics in gaming.

Here's what Xbox said, what it didn’t, and why the future of Game Pass still raises big questions for developers, publishers, and players alike.

📝 Companion blog post – The Tools I Use as a Designer: https://www.modmusings.com/blog/the-tools-i-use-as-a-designer

▬▬▬▬ Video Overview ▬▬▬▬
In this video, I'll walk you through my product design process, showcasing the key tools and apps at each stage. I'll demonstrate how I use sketching tools, Fusion 360 for 3D modeling, and Cinema 4D for rendering to create industrial-inspired designs. You'll also see how I leverage Figma for design documentation, Adobe Illustrator for packaging, and my complete setup for product photography and marketing videos.

At the end, you'll see the projects I've been working on over the past year: the Industrial Series. This includes the Encore Series 3 keyboard I designed with Mode and a new line of precision-machined pens with Inventery. Both products are an extension of my original “X-Ray Collection”, which uses translucent polycarbonate that reveals internal components, complemented by premium materials like brushed steel and copper.

<div id="summary-41" class="summary" style="display: none;">So today, one of our beloved domain controller decided to nosedive during Windows Update.A collegue informed me about it because he noticed that a backup plan stopped working for this server.I log in to investigate and am greeted by this gem:The paging file is too small for this operation to complete.Huh.Open Event Viewer - Event ID 2004 - Resource Exhaustion Detector shouting into the void. Turns out:MsSense.exe: 12.7GBMsMpEng.exe: 3.3GBupdater.exe: 1.6GBTotal: roughly more than three times what the box even had.Cool cool. So how much RAM does this DC have?4GB. FOUR. On a domain controller. Running Defender for Endpoint.Just when I think "surely the pagefile saved it," I run:Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_PageFileSettingAnd there it is:MaximumSize : 0 Name : D:\pagefile.sysZERO.Zero kilobytes of coping mechanism. On D:.Which isn’t even the system volume.It's like giving someone a thimble of water and telling them to run a marathon in July.Anyway, i rebooted it out of pure spite. It came back. Somehow.Meanwhile i've created a task for the datacenter responsibles like:Can we please stop bullshitting and start fixing our base configs?submitted by/u/Funkenzutzler[link][comments]</div>

Trying to look rich is one of the biggest reasons people stay broke. In this video, I reveal 7 reasons why chasing luxury—cars, designer clothes, big houses—can actually destroy your financial future. From lifestyle inflation and debt to poor money habits and the need for validation, we break down how this mindset keeps people stuck.

<div id="summary-50" class="summary" style="display: none;">In this week’s episode, we visit a 60 sqm apartment in Tanjong Pagar, one of Singapore’s oldest neighbourhoods known for its hawker centre and historic shophouses. Originally built in the 1970s, the apartment has been reconfigured from a two-bedroom layout into a single-bedroom home with an open-plan living area. The design blends nostalgia with a minimalist approach, using natural textures such as grey stone flooring, warm wood cabinetry and limewashed walls to bring a renewed sense of life to the old unit.

<div id="summary-62" class="summary" style="display: none;">Hot damn! Issue 4 of the Never Too Small Magazine is out now and available to purchase https://www.nts-store.com/. It's a wild ride through colour, creativity, and small-space brilliance. Get your copy now.

Architect Caroline Duncan's compact apartment is bright, flexible and full of custom DIY solutions and  smart storage. Thoughtful, inventive details include a customised Muji bench that provides both window seating and hidden storage, a modular felt sofa that easily converts into a bed, and a cat-friendly laundry nook that discreetly houses a litter box. The kitchen is a seamless blend of high and low, combining IKEA carcasses with bespoke birch plywood fronts and porcelain handles inherited from family. A full-height storage wall cleverly unifies the kitchen and wardrobe space while concealing a mirrored door to the bedroom. Subtle multifunctionality is scattered through-out the home: a recessed headboard niche doubles as a projector shelf, and a wall-mounted desk preserves the openness of the living space.

<div id="summary-63" class="summary" style="display: none;">I'm really wrestling with a directive from HR. They want to implement employee monitoring software for our hundreds of remote employees. The biggest headache is doing this without a massive backlash. I'm thinking about solutions that allow for silent, automated install. It's not only solid activity monitoring software and app and website tracking we need but also something easy to manage at scale for remote team management. Any thoughts on how to pull this off without causing a panic? Or pitfalls to avoid for workforce analytics at this scale? Thanks.submitted by/u/Expert-Economics-723[link][comments]</div>

<h2><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1mdqf01/why_i_like_working_for_a_large_enterprise/" target="_blank">Why I like working for a large enterprise</a></h2>

<button class="toggle-summary-btn" data-target="summary-65">...</button>
<div id="summary-65" class="summary" style="display: none;">In the past there has been back and forth about this with people in smaller shops having one opinion and people in the large shops having another, and we definitely have our share of issues in the large enterprise, but I can say we do not have the following problems I see popping up here all the time.Secretary storing stuff in the network closed?Nope. Only authorized IT contacts have keys and policy forbids storage in network closets.Boss demands to have a list of everyone's passwords.Nope. Nobody can have anyone else's password by policy. Doing so would result in termination. No boss can override thisRandom desktop on a shelf in the data centerNope. Desktop computers are not allowed in the data center. Period.25 year old desktop with NT4 running the voicemail system in a closetNope. This would be a massive violation of the information security policy.Boss doesn't like MFA and forces you to turn it off for his accountNope. Information security policy requires everyone have MFA no matter who they are.A manager wants access to a former employee's email account and then starts sending email as them for months on endNope. If an employee leaves it requires multiple approvals including HR to get access to their email account, and only for long enough to copy the mail out and then it is closed down again. Old accounts can not be kept open indefinitely. Business process needs to be built around this because when people leave their accounts are absolutely deleted after a grace period.The finance lady insists she must have her own personal printer and the boss says to give it to herNope. There is no "finance lady" because finance is an entire department staffed by employees who have to operate as employees like everyone else and use the same equipment as everyone else. They can use secure release on the same printers as everyone else.It isn't all sunshine and roses by any means but we don't do a bunch of stupid nonsense that is just blatantly awful. There are no hubs under desks and servers in the bathroom. The microwave is not an IT responsibility. IT does not assemble furniture. We have a standard replacement cycle for our laptops every 3-4 years. Nobody has a gaming PC on their desk because they think they're special. Random non-technical executives do not have domain admin access just because they want it.We have a whole host of other issues, but at least we have none of these problems.submitted by/u/crankysysadmin[link][comments]</div>

“Foundation” has captivated audiences with its intricate world-building, stunning visuals, bold storytelling, and compelling performances. Season 3 continues the epic chronicle of a band of exiles on their monumental journey to save humanity and rebuild civilization amid the fall of the Galactic Empire. 

Set 152 years after the events of Season 2, the Foundation has become increasingly established far beyond its humble beginnings while the Cleonic Dynasty’s Empire has dwindled. As both of these galactic powers forge an uneasy alliance, a threat to the entire galaxy appears in the fearsome form of a warlord known as “The Mule” whose sights are set on ruling the universe by use of physical and military force, as well as mind control. It’s anyone’s guess who will win, who will lose, who will live, and who will die as Hari Seldon, Gaal Dornick, the Cleons, and Demerzel play a potentially deadly game of intergalactic chess.

🎧 About This Video
Vampire Weekend is one of the only bands in history to land three #1 albums on the Billboard 200… without ever landing a single on the Hot 100. Not even A-Punk. In a music industry driven by hits, charts and TikTok virality, how did this band build a career entirely around albums? And what does that say about the way we measure success in music today?

I’m breaking down the paradox at the heart of Vampire Weekend’s career: from Contra to Modern Vampires to Only God Was Above Us and exploring how they’ve stayed true to album-first artistry in a singles-first world.

<div id="summary-128" class="summary" style="display: none;">North Korea just siphoned 17 million dollars through U-S remote jobs.

This video shows how U-S citizen Christina Chapman stockpiled laptops so DPRK workers could masquerade as Americans, win remote IT roles, and defraud 309 U-S companies, including many Fortune 500 firms, plus two abroad. Using 68 stolen identities, the ring moved millions before Chapman received a 102-month federal sentence.

What you’ll learn
• How the laptop farm operated
• Why standard vetting failed remote teams
• Simple steps to block insider threats today

This isn’t just a synthwave playlist — it’s a feeling, a dimension, a trip into the sonic beyond.
🎹 Crafted by Frequency, these tracks hit deeper than nostalgia — they breathe life into light and loneliness.

🛸 Let the synths guide you past stardust highways, through violet skies and electric dreams.
Every beat is a heartbeat of a dying star. Every melody — a memory from a future that never happened.
🌌 Feel the cosmic melancholy, the glow of the retro-future, and the gravity of emotion.

✨ This is where time dissolves and sound takes over. Play loud. Float away. Feel everything.

<div id="summary-139" class="summary" style="display: none;">This beautifully designed mouse helped me gain some MMR 💥

The AX5 Pro from @mchose_official pulls off a unique exoskeleton-inspired design with sacrificing comfort or performance. It’s a super lightweight gaming-focused mouse, with a smooth glide and a fast polling rate. To be honest, I’m just a sucker for its unique design. But I’m certain that gamers who want to climb fast are going to appreciate its ergonomic grip, and its responsive and light nature.

This must be my current favorite gaming mouse atm.

<div id="summary-143" class="summary" style="display: none;">Basically the CEO and senior leadership wants to have some sort of tracking software ensuring no remote workers are working out of Province or out of country.We are a small organization that uses Google Workspace with some users that have access to the Microsoft world (Teams, Excel and the whole suite)We are currently using Intune, Sentinel one and GoTo resolve. All these systems feed us the IPs and other information to track the users but it's passive and we would have to check individual records.Any software in the market that will help us achieve this tracking request?Thanks in advance fellow sysadminssubmitted by/u/186notout[link][comments]</div>

“Foundation” has captivated audiences with its intricate world-building, stunning visuals, bold storytelling, and compelling performances. Season 3 continues the epic chronicle of a band of exiles on their monumental journey to save humanity and rebuild civilization amid the fall of the Galactic Empire. 

Set 152 years after the events of Season 2, the Foundation has become increasingly established far beyond its humble beginnings while the Cleonic Dynasty’s Empire has dwindled. As both of these galactic powers forge an uneasy alliance, a threat to the entire galaxy appears in the fearsome form of a warlord known as “The Mule” whose sights are set on ruling the universe by use of physical and military force, as well as mind control. It’s anyone’s guess who will win, who will lose, who will live, and who will die as Hari Seldon, Gaal Dornick, the Cleons, and Demerzel play a potentially deadly game of intergalactic chess.

<div id="summary-197" class="summary" style="display: none;">This is a sleeping bag that sucks blood away from your brain! And they're making it into pants... 

On earth, gravity helps your blood naturally circulate away from your brain. But in zero G, your blood isn’t getting pulled away from your head anymore.

Astronauts say being in Zero G feels like you’re being hung slightly upside down. 

So scientists are experimenting with using negative pressure to pull your blood away from your brain. The goal is to eventually turn this bag version into a pair of pants.

Astronauts in the future could put these blood-sucking anti-gravity pants on and help their brains feel like they’re still on Earth.

<div id="summary-203" class="summary" style="display: none;">I'm an IT asset manager for a mid-size healthcare tech company. We recently acquired a smaller firm (about 100 remote staff) that operates on a tight budget and issues Chromebooks instead of full desktop setups. Their provisioning costs are around $700 per user (Chromebook + basic accessories), compared to our standard $2,000 setups (PC/Mac + dual monitors, dock, wireless peripherals).Here’s the issue: the acquired company pays new hires in the range of $12–$15/hour, and we’ve had a wave of "ghost hires"—people who accept the job, sign onboarding forms acknowledging their responsibility for the equipment, receive a new Chromebook and monitor by the end of the week… and never show up on Monday. No login, no reply to texts or automated emails, no returns. They just reset the Chromebook and keep it.Because these Chromebooks aren't enrolled in Google Admin Console or Chrome Enterprise, they can be wiped and reused without restriction. Unlike Windows Autopilot or JAMF for Macs (which enforce re-enrollment post-reset), these units are effectively unsecured.Due to HR policy, I can’t initiate recovery contact directly, and after 15–20 days of silence, I have to close the onboarding ticket and forward the case to HR. We've lost 11 Chromebooks in just over 2 months. Accounting is livid since they have to approve new purchases, and HR (as far as I know) hasn’t escalated or pursued recovery.So I'm stuck between weak controls, no enforcement, and growing costs.Has anyone dealt with something similar? Are there creative ways to protect Chromebook assets from this kind of loss—policy, tech, or workflow-wise? Open to suggestions.What would you do?submitted by/u/Silent_Justice[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-205" class="summary" style="display: none;">Google’s Sameer Samat says Android and ChromeOS are becoming a single platform, with ChromeOS built on Android’s underlying technology. In a 14 July tweet, he reiterates the 2024 blog post: the goal is better performance, faster iteration, and seamless laptop–phone integration. In this video, we unpack what that could mean for your workflow, how it might change Android laptops, and how it compares with Apple’s iOS “walled garden.” Do you use Android or ChromeOS today, and would this unified approach make you switch or stay?

But trying to get certain people to let go of their desktop printer is quite difficult.Weirdly it always seems to be finance that want to print everything off and not have to get out of their seat to collect it. Even if I explain how much HP toners cost and when the printer dies I need to buy a new one, which tends to be a different model and needs different toner.submitted by/u/AverageMuggle99[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-227" class="summary" style="display: none;">If you have noticed Ninja support going downhill fast, it's because they've offloaded support to the Phillipines. Exypnox Inc to be exact. One of their techs was working with me, and I noticed the quality of their answers not being great and the grammar tipped me off. I asked him to be transferred to the US-based support team, which he said he was indeed US-based. I then searched him on Linked in and it showed a man from the phillipines, with Exypnox Inc as their current employer and the description of said employment is what tipped off that they are working for ninja"MSP Support Engineer for RMM service and provide over all support technical support for client in regards to their IT issue."So, NinjaONE, if you see this, why are you cutting costs and offloading support to the Phillipines? I thought you guys were all for quality and taking care of the MSP sector?Calling outu/jcroweninjarmmfor any information on this.First post was locked/deleted then restored but locked for going off-topic.So please keep this one on topic!Edit:u/Michaelatninjarmmhas replied herehttps://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1mbwpob/comment/n5qburl/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_buttonEDIT(again):Hi Guys,Honestly, the fact that so many people have had these issues and are speaking out-- and that Ninja is actually listening is great. I've been in contact with Jon and I have complete faith that things are going to change at Ninja for the better support wise.For everyone who's on the fence with ninja-- don't be. Even with the revelation of offshore support in some capacity, and with some support issues, I 100000% do not regret moving to Ninja. What we're able to do in Ninja easily vs our old tools, and tools we were looking at, is amazing. The accessibility of all the features is amazing and it does a damn good job at them. I'm speaking from the heart, because I kind of feel bad for how I jumped the gun and went nuclear. I didn't expect to get the responses I have.But heck, the fact that the SVP of Strategy/CoS of the CEO posted at midnight really does show they give a crap. and I have a meeting with Ninja tomorrow to speak to them about the issues we have faced as a company with them, and with everything brought up by the community.

Jordan Bloemen and Scott Francis Winder delve into the shadowy world of digital ad fraud, uncovering how cybercriminals exploit the vast programmatic advertising ecosystem. They explore the intricate mechanisms behind ad fraud operations, highlighting the significant financial impact on legitimate businesses and the broader internet economy. As digital advertising continues to generate nearly a trillion dollars annually, understanding these fraudulent schemes is more crucial than ever.

Jordan and Scott take listeners through the rise and fall of Alexander Zhukov, infamously known as the "King of Fraud," who orchestrated the Methbot ad fraud network. By simulating human interactions with ads on fabricated websites, Zhukov tricked major brands into paying millions for non-existent ad impressions. The hosts explain how such operations not only defraud advertisers but also serve as sophisticated vehicles for money laundering, turning illicit funds into seemingly legitimate revenue streams.

The discussion further examines the technical aspects of ad fraud, including spoofing legitimate websites and manipulating real-time bidding auctions to generate fake ad traffic. Jordan and Scott highlight the challenges faced by cybersecurity experts in combating these ever-evolving threats, emphasizing the continuous cat-and-mouse game between fraudsters and those working to secure the digital advertising landscape. They also shed light on recent takedowns like the Vast Flux campaign, showcasing the ongoing efforts to dismantle large-scale fraud networks.

Building intrigue around the complexities of ad fraud, this episode offers valuable insights for both cybersecurity enthusiasts and digital marketers. By revealing the hidden layers of the ad tech ecosystem and the relentless pursuit to eliminate fraud, Jordan Bloemen and Scott Francis Winder create a compelling narrative that underscores the importance of vigilance and innovation in protecting t

he integrity of online advertising. Tune in to understand the high-stakes battle against ad fraud and its implications for the future of digital media.</div>

<div id="summary-235" class="summary" style="display: none;">I just wanted to share my experience finally demoing the Apple Vision Pro this past weekend.I had time to kill at Memorial City Mall, one of the busiest malls, located off one of the busiest freeways (Katy Freeway) in Houston, the fourth-largest city in the U.S. While my wife and kids were back-to-school shopping, I wandered into the packed Apple Store. Everything was bustling, except for the Apple Vision Pro table, which stood out like a deserted island in a sea of dynamic islands.I've never done the demo, so I scanned the QR code to schedule one. The next slot was in 10 minutes, so I messed around with some Macs (Sneaky Sasquatch has reached dock status, FYI).Eventually, an employee checked to make sure I hadn’t accidentally signed up for a class or Genius Bar appointment. A few minutes later, another employee came over, friendly but with big “just got pulled off break” energy, and told me I was thefirst person in weeksto request a Vision Pro demo during his shifts.The demo itself? Mind-blowing, of course, but also neck-breaking. I’ve got pre-existing neck issues, and the weight of the unit started taking a toll within minutes. But hey, the Metallica concert was cool.Here’s the interesting part: while I was mid-demo, I heard two or three different people come over and ask about trying it themselves. The not-thrilled employee told them they’d have to sign up via the QR code too.So it begs the question: if a Vision Pro falls in the forest and no one’s there to see it, does it make a sound? Apparently not. It’s fallen so far off the radar that shoppers just walk right past it, until someone’s using it. Then it’s like a sign spinner outside a tire shop.Maybe Apple just needs to have someone visibly using it to draw a crowd again?Either way, it’s got to be at least half as heavy and half as expensive for me even to consider it.submitted by/u/neatgeek83[link][comments]</div>

Based on the award-winning novels by Isaac Asimov, Foundation chronicles a band of exiles on their monumental journey to save humanity and rebuild civilization amid the fall of the Galactic Empire.

<div id="summary-260" class="summary" style="display: none;">So been in my current role for 18 months, technically a 3rd line sysadmin - but doing everything from 1st to 3rd - only 10% of my time is as a 3rd liner.Found another role, and handed my notice in, still have 2/3 of my notice to work out (UK - so we generally have long notice periods).New employer called me up - general catch up and chit chat. Then he drops the bombshell - your company gave a normal (yes he worked here) type reference, but your boss gave a separate negative one. Shell-shocked to be honest. Anyway he goes on to say he is not worried and I still have a job to go to.Whilst I am sorting this out with my HR director - did get me thinking. What "cunning stunt" would you leave lying around as a farewell gift for him well after you leave?Edit:Thanks for all the replies - amazing response 😊HR director has been amazing. She is going to handle this in a discreet and has offered to speak to my new employer if needs must.Was never planning to anything nasty, just annoying - so might invest in some annoy-a-tron to dot around the office and server room 😝 Thank you allsubmitted by/u/BigPete_2025[link][comments]</div>

We also go deep on buggies (yes, again), improvements to AI and combat, and the studio’s philosophy around retaining talent and preserving games.

<div id="summary-273" class="summary" style="display: none;">Pete Buttigieg says there’s been “rough and tumble politics” throughout U.S. history but what is happening today is “different in a way that offends every fiber of American civic values.”

The one-time democratic presidential candidate tells NPR Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep that “we have a president who really is attempting to become an autocrat and in some ways has succeeded."

Today I'll show you how I used Bubble to build and publish a real, working mobile app. It's a version of the Sam, the Prompt Creator GPT I made a while back that got really popular, and I wanted it to be available to more people, so I used Bubble to take it from a limited custom GPT to a fully functional, published app. To be clear I just built this app to trst the process and do not plan to maintain the application.

<div id="summary-276" class="summary" style="display: none;">Curious to hear how others are experiencing the IT job market right now. I’ve been seeing a lot of conversations about the field becoming oversaturated especially with more people entering tech chasing high salaries or remote work flexibility.Are you seeing more competition for roles? Has the demand for sysadmins and IT pros actually slowed down? Or is it just shifting toward cloud, DevOps, and automation-heavy roles?Honestly I’d love to hear your insights whether you’re hiring, job hunting, or just observing trends from within.submitted by/u/Thatmangifted[link][comments]</div>

<div id="summary-290" class="summary" style="display: none;">What comes after the human?

We’re living through multiple crises — ecological, technological, political. But beneath all of that is something even deeper: a crisis of the self. Who are we, really? How did we come to see ourselves as separate from the world, from each other, from the systems that sustain us? And what if that way of thinking is what got us into this mess?

Today’s guest is Mark C. Taylor, philosopher, cultural critic, and author of After the Human. Mark and Sean discuss the philosophical roots of climate change, the dangers of individualism, the false promise of techno-utopianism, and what it might mean to shift from seeing ourselves as isolated egos to members of a vast, interdependent web. They talk about AI, death, Hegel, Descartes, hope, and why ideas matter.

<div id="summary-293" class="summary" style="display: none;">What do 7-Zip and the Crowdstrike incident have in common? A ticking time bomb.

In this video, we break down the critical vulnerability affecting all 7-Zip versions before 25—and why it’s still haunting systems everywhere. From desk machines to build servers, outdated 7-Zip installs are quietly leaving environments wide open.

And here’s the kicker: 7-Zip doesn’t auto-update. No prompts. No warnings. Just silent exposure.

We also connect the dots to the Crowdstrike debacle, exposing the larger issue behind it all—the broken state of third-party patch management. Learn how to fix the disconnect, close the vulnerability gap, and finally take control of your app security.

<button class="toggle-summary-btn" data-target="summary-299">...</button>
<div id="summary-299" class="summary" style="display: none;">Starting the week by sharing how I shoot overhead shots. 📸

One of my favorite ways to compose photos and videos is through flat lays. I typically use a focal length between 24mm to 30mm (on an APS-C sensor). Wide enough for good coverage, but tight enough to reduce distortion. I just correct the lens distortions on post. 

The camera is mounted on a C-stand, which is weighted and sturdy enough to support heavier rigs. It also lets me attach counterweights for stability, and even add a fill light or monitor on the opposite end.

If I’m filming with audio, I always do a quick gain check to avoid clipping. Wireless mics are a must for this kind of setup because they’re super versatile and easy to move around with.

Then I hit the shutter and let the frame do the work. ✨

Save this for your next flat-lay shoot, and share this with a friend for their reference. Don’t gate-keep! 

Happy start of the week, friends!

It walks through the attack timeline, explains how the packages fetched a malicious script from GitHub, covers the Arch Linux team’s removal of the offending packages on July 18, and offers best practices for auditing and hardening your system against future threats.

Victor Riparbelli, CEO & Co-founder of Synthesia, breaks down why going viral isn’t the goal — and how to know if you’re building something “fun and cool” or truly useful.

It took 8 years of pivots and countless user conversations to figure out what people actually needed. By solving a problem most teams ignored, Synthesia scaled to $100M ARR and reached a $2.1B valuation.

Are you building something people actually need — or just something that looks impressive?

<p class="published-date">2025-07-27 12:48:35</p>
<p class="feed-title">Exploring Alternatives</p>
<button class="toggle-summary-btn" data-target="summary-314">...</button>
<div id="summary-314" class="summary" style="display: none;">When Steve and Christine moved back to BC after being up in the Yukon for over a decade, they were looking to buy an affordable home in one of North America's most expensive cities: Vancouver, BC.  They were looking at small condos, but also stayed open to alternatives and ended up exploring float homes.  They found a 40-year old homemade float home for sale that was a definitely fixer upper, but they had no idea just how much work was needed until they started removing the flooring and had a roof leak and realized there was an ongoing water damage issue.  They ended up having to hire contractors to do some structural work, to replace the roof, and to add more styrofoam flotation, and they also did some aesthetic renovations themselves like redoing the floors, and putting in a new kitchen and bathroom.

The couple has created their dream home on the water – what they call the "last affordable home in Vancouver" – and they've lived there for just over a year with their dog Lozen and their cat Kitten.  They say that despite the unexpected renovations, living on the water has turned out better than they expected.  They love the community and neighbours at the marina, the proximity to both natural spaces and city amenities, and of course the affordability compared to a home on land.

But living on the water isn't without it's challenges.  The couple shares that moorage contracts at their marina are year-to-year so there is always a little bit of insecurity there, knowing that the marina owners could choose not to renew their moorage from one year to the next.  And there are also day-to-day quirks to live with, like the fact that the home sometimes "bottoms out" during really low tides, and that the exposed pipes can freeze during Vancouver's brief subzero winters.  But overall, Steve and Christine say they are really happy with their choice to live on the water.

Special thank you to Maria Senajova for putting us in touch with Steve and Christine and for being such a great realtor for them :)

<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCjOADLbDo8" target="_blank">She got ancient hermit tower, cave & chapel for the price of a car</a></h2>

<div id="summary-315" class="summary" style="display: none;">In the wild, stony hills of the Mani Peninsula—once home to pirates, hermits, and feuding clans— Elena Zervoudakis stumbled upon a ruin so isolated it could only be reached by foot, up a stone path carved into the mountainside. Her friends urged her to spend the money on something more sensible —like a vehicle— but Elena, though only a student, was enchanted. 

She bought the 18th-century megalithic home for the price of a car and spent the next 15 years making plans for the remodel worthy of its surroundings; Maina House is a megalithic home nestled among a 16th-century defense tower and a Byzantine chapel adorned with 12th-century frescoes.

Fifteen years later, with no road access, electricity, or plumbing, she began restoring the ruin stone by stone. Every tile, every beam, every tool had to be carried by hand up the winding path. In response, she designed a minimalist, bioclimatic home, deeply rooted in both the landscape and the traditional ways of the region.

Over the decades, Elena’s dream evolved into a 3-level, 150-square-meter tower-house that flows with the mountain itself. It opens to a cave below via a trapdoor staircase, and pays tribute to its centuries-old past at every turn. There's also a cave in the side yard that's used for summer siestas.

Now a retreat shared with just two full-time residents of the tiny village, the home feels like a passage through time—a lived-in relic that whispers of monastic solitude, fierce independence, and the quiet luxury of living with only what one truly needs.

<div id="summary-323" class="summary" style="display: none;">Owen Wilson stars in the new sports comedy series Stick, now streaming on Apple TV+ https://apple.co/_Stick

In “Stick,” Owen Wilson stars as Pryce Cahill, an over-the-hill, ex-pro golfer whose career was derailed prematurely 20 years ago. After the collapse of his marriage and getting fired from his job at an Indiana sporting goods store, Pryce hedges his bets, and future, entirely on a troubled 17-year-old golf phenom named Santi (Peter Dager). “Stick” is a heartfelt, feel-good comedy about a found family and their relationships set within the world of golf as it has never been shown before.

In addition to Wilson and Dager, the ensemble cast includes Marc Maron, Mariana Treviño, Lilli Kay, Judy Greer and Timothy Olyphant, and features guest appearances from golf superstars such as Collin Morikawa, Keegan Bradley, Max Homa, Wyndham Clark and more. Additional cameos include broadcasters Jim Nantz and Trevor Immelman, Good Good’s Matt Scharff, Brad Dalke and Garrett Clark, as well as golf enthusiast Dan Rapaport.

“Stick” is showrun by Keller, who also serves as executive producer alongside Wilson, Ben Silverman for Propagate Content and Entertainment 360’s Guymon Casady. The series is also executive produced by Howard T. Owens, Rodney Ferrell, Drew Buckley, Lee Eisenberg, Natalie Sandy, Christopher Moynihan, Bill Callahan, Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton. Faris and Dayton serve as directors along with David Dobkin, Jaffar Mahmood, M.J. Delaney and John Hamburg.

A candid conversation between David and Network Chuck at Cisco Live 2025 about the unexpected revival of networking in the age of AI. They dive into how AI tools temporarily sidetracked their content focus, why core infrastructure skills remain indispensable, and how a welcoming networking community pulled Chuck back after years away. They announced plans to relaunch a CCNA video series, share insights on combining AI with networking, and offer practical YouTube advice for tech creators.

<div id="summary-358" class="summary" style="display: none;">Been at the same company for 24 years (yeah I know 🙄)Long story short….. now looking after 11 sites based the length and breadth of the UK (x2 large manufacturing, x4 large distribution warehouses and 5 office) …. Originally only looked after 2 sites.Total number of IT users is circa 400 (sales reps,office staff, factory/distribution staff) On call 24/6 as our manufacturing and manufacturing sites run min-sat.I look after 35 servers in total, 20x VMware virtual, rest physical at each other sites.I deal with all infrastructure/security/project work etc etc…. Basically everything bar the software development side.Was allowed to employ a single trainee 2 years ago, because I said I’d leave if I didn’t have someone to help me out as the stress was becoming too much.Now my question is…… how many IT admins/ Helpdesk would a company of this size usually employ ?I’m paid £55k a year btw……which I don’t think is enough! I joke that if you actually work out the number of things I look after, I’m actually paid less than an India call centre 🫣submitted by/u/muzzy22[link][comments]</div>

Thoughtful, inventive details include a customised Muji bench that provides both window seating and hidden storage, a modular felt sofa that easily converts into a bed, and a cat-friendly laundry nook that discreetly houses a litter box. The kitchen is a seamless blend of high and low, combining IKEA carcasses with bespoke birch plywood fronts and porcelain handles inherited from family. A full-height storage wall cleverly unifies the kitchen and wardrobe space while concealing a mirrored door to the bedroom. Subtle multifunctionality is scattered through-out the home: a recessed headboard niche doubles as a projector shelf, and a wall-mounted desk preserves the openness of the living space.\n\n00:00-00:57 Introduction \n00:57-01:22 Location \n01:22-03:31 Floor Plan\n03:31-04:49 Entrance\n04:49-06:46 Living Area\n06:46-10:00 Kitchen\n10:00-11:46 Bedroom\n11:46-12:44 Bathroom\n12:44-13:39 Conclusion\n\n#smallapartment #architecture #interiordesign \n\nEp 230\nProject Name: Caroline Duncan's Apartment\nArchitect: https://www.instagram.com/caro_duncan/ \n\nProduced by New Mac Video Agency\nCreator: Colin Chee\nProducer: Lindsay Barnard\nDirector and Cinematographer: Nam Tran\nEditor: Jessica Ruasol\nMusic: Artlist.io\nSunset by Ben Hendler\nDreaming of a Song by Amos Ever Hadani\nReflection Lake by Ariel Shalom\nMoon Dance by JADE VY\n\nShare your projects with us- https://www.nevertoosmall.com/submissions\nSubscribe to our newsletter- https://www.nevertoosmall.com/subscribe \nCheck out our store- https://www.nts-store.com\nWebsite- https://www.nevertoosmall.com\nInstagram-  https://www.instagram.com/nvtsmall\nFacebook- https://www.facebook.com/nvtsmall",

Only authorized IT contacts have keys and policy forbids storage in network closets.Boss demands to have a list of everyone's passwords.Nope. Nobody can have anyone else's password by policy. Doing so would result in termination. No boss can override thisRandom desktop on a shelf in the data centerNope. Desktop computers are not allowed in the data center. Period.25 year old desktop with NT4 running the voicemail system in a closetNope. This would be a massive violation of the information security policy.Boss doesn't like MFA and forces you to turn it off for his accountNope. Information security policy requires everyone have MFA no matter who they are.A manager wants access to a former employee's email account and then starts sending email as them for months on endNope. If an employee leaves it requires multiple approvals including HR to get access to their email account, and only for long enough to copy the mail out and then it is closed down again. Old accounts can not be kept open indefinitely. Business process needs to be built around this because when people leave their accounts are absolutely deleted after a grace period.The finance lady insists she must have her own personal printer and the boss says to give it to herNope. There is no \"finance lady\" because finance is an entire department staffed by employees who have to operate as employees like everyone else and use the same equipment as everyone else. They can use secure release on the same printers as everyone else.It isn't all sunshine and roses by any means but we don't do a bunch of stupid nonsense that is just blatantly awful. There are no hubs under desks and servers in the bathroom. The microwave is not an IT responsibility. IT does not assemble furniture. We have a standard replacement cycle for our laptops every 3-4 years. Nobody has a gaming PC on their desk because they think they're special. Random non-technical executives do not have domain admin access just because they want it.We have a whole host of other issues, but at least we have none of these problems.submitted by/u/crankysysadmin[link][comments]",

We recently acquired a smaller firm (about 100 remote staff) that operates on a tight budget and issues Chromebooks instead of full desktop setups. Their provisioning costs are around $700 per user (Chromebook + basic accessories), compared to our standard $2,000 setups (PC/Mac + dual monitors, dock, wireless peripherals).Here\u2019s the issue: the acquired company pays new hires in the range of $12\u2013$15/hour, and we\u2019ve had a wave of \"ghost hires\"\u2014people who accept the job, sign onboarding forms acknowledging their responsibility for the equipment, receive a new Chromebook and monitor by the end of the week\u2026 and never show up on Monday. No login, no reply to texts or automated emails, no returns. They just reset the Chromebook and keep it.Because these Chromebooks aren't enrolled in Google Admin Console or Chrome Enterprise, they can be wiped and reused without restriction. Unlike Windows Autopilot or JAMF for Macs (which enforce re-enrollment post-reset), these units are effectively unsecured.Due to HR policy, I can\u2019t initiate recovery contact directly, and after 15\u201320 days of silence, I have to close the onboarding ticket and forward the case to HR. We've lost 11 Chromebooks in just over 2 months. Accounting is livid since they have to approve new purchases, and HR (as far as I know) hasn\u2019t escalated or pursued recovery.So I'm stuck between weak controls, no enforcement, and growing costs.Has anyone dealt with something similar? Are there creative ways to protect Chromebook assets from this kind of loss\u2014policy, tech, or workflow-wise? Open to suggestions.What would you do?submitted by/u/Silent_Justice[link][comments]",

I've been in contact with Jon and I have complete faith that things are going to change at Ninja for the better support wise.For everyone who's on the fence with ninja-- don't be. Even with the revelation of offshore support in some capacity, and with some support issues, I 100000% do not regret moving to Ninja. What we're able to do in Ninja easily vs our old tools, and tools we were looking at, is amazing. The accessibility of all the features is amazing and it does a damn good job at them. I'm speaking from the heart, because I kind of feel bad for how I jumped the gun and went nuclear. I didn't expect to get the responses I have.But heck, the fact that the SVP of Strategy/CoS of the CEO posted at midnight really does show they give a crap. and I have a meeting with Ninja tomorrow to speak to them about the issues we have faced as a company with them, and with everything brought up by the community. I'm hopeful.Ninja is a great company. Don't let my post stop you from considering them.submitted by/u/Cj_Staal[link][comments]",

They explore the intricate mechanisms behind ad fraud operations, highlighting the significant financial impact on legitimate businesses and the broader internet economy. As digital advertising continues to generate nearly a trillion dollars annually, understanding these fraudulent schemes is more crucial than ever.\n\nJordan and Scott take listeners through the rise and fall of Alexander Zhukov, infamously known as the \"King of Fraud,\" who orchestrated the Methbot ad fraud network. By simulating human interactions with ads on fabricated websites, Zhukov tricked major brands into paying millions for non-existent ad impressions. The hosts explain how such operations not only defraud advertisers but also serve as sophisticated vehicles for money laundering, turning illicit funds into seemingly legitimate revenue streams.\n\nThe discussion further examines the technical aspects of ad fraud, including spoofing legitimate websites and manipulating real-time bidding auctions to generate fake ad traffic. Jordan and Scott highlight the challenges faced by cybersecurity experts in combating these ever-evolving threats, emphasizing the continuous cat-and-mouse game between fraudsters and those working to secure the digital advertising landscape. They also shed light on recent takedowns like the Vast Flux campaign, showcasing the ongoing efforts to dismantle large-scale fraud networks.\n\nBuilding intrigue around the complexities of ad fraud, this episode offers valuable insights for both cybersecurity enthusiasts and digital marketers. By revealing the hidden layers of the ad tech ecosystem and the relentless pursuit to eliminate fraud, Jordan Bloemen and Scott Francis Winder create a compelling narrative that underscores the importance of vigilance and innovation in protecting t\n\nhe integrity of online advertising.

I then searched him on Linked in and it showed a man from the phillipines, with Exypnox Inc as their current employer and the description of said employment is what tipped off that they are working for ninja\"MSP Support Engineer for RMM service and provide over all support technical support for client in regards to their IT issue.\"So, NinjaONE, if you see this, why are you cutting costs and offloading support to the Phillipines? I thought you guys were all for quality and taking care of the MSP sector?edit: Calling outu/jcroweninjarmmfor any information on this.Hi Guys,Honestly, the fact that so many people have had these issues and are speaking out-- and that Ninja is actually listening is great. I've been in contact with Jon and I have complete faith that things are going to change at Ninja for the better support wise.For everyone who's on the fence with ninja-- don't be. Even with the revelation of offshore support in some capacity, and with some support issues, I 100000% do not regret moving to Ninja. What we're able to do in Ninja easily vs our old tools, and tools we were looking at, is amazing. The accessibility of all the features is amazing and it does a damn good job at them. I'm speaking from the heart, because I kind of feel bad for how I jumped the gun and went nuclear. I didn't expect to get the responses I have.But heck, the fact that the SVP of Strategy/CoS of the CEO posted at midnight really does show they give a crap. and I have a meeting with Ninja tomorrow to speak to them about the issues we have faced as a company with them, and with everything brought up by the community. I'm hopeful.Ninja is a great company. Don't let my post stop you from considering them.submitted by/u/Cj_Staal[link][comments]",

Everything was bustling, except for the Apple Vision Pro table, which stood out like a deserted island in a sea of dynamic islands.I've never done the demo, so I scanned the QR code to schedule one. The next slot was in 10 minutes, so I messed around with some Macs (Sneaky Sasquatch has reached dock status, FYI).Eventually, an employee checked to make sure I hadn\u2019t accidentally signed up for a class or Genius Bar appointment. A few minutes later, another employee came over, friendly but with big \u201cjust got pulled off break\u201d energy, and told me I was thefirst person in weeksto request a Vision Pro demo during his shifts.The demo itself? Mind-blowing, of course, but also neck-breaking. I\u2019ve got pre-existing neck issues, and the weight of the unit started taking a toll within minutes. But hey, the Metallica concert was cool.Here\u2019s the interesting part: while I was mid-demo, I heard two or three different people come over and ask about trying it themselves. The not-thrilled employee told them they\u2019d have to sign up via the QR code too.So it begs the question: if a Vision Pro falls in the forest and no one\u2019s there to see it, does it make a sound? Apparently not. It\u2019s fallen so far off the radar that shoppers just walk right past it, until someone\u2019s using it. Then it\u2019s like a sign spinner outside a tire shop.Maybe Apple just needs to have someone visibly using it to draw a crowd again?Either way, it\u2019s got to be at least half as heavy and half as expensive for me even to consider it.submitted by/u/neatgeek83[link][comments]",

But beneath all of that is something even deeper: a crisis of the self. Who are we, really? How did we come to see ourselves as separate from the world, from each other, from the systems that sustain us? And what if that way of thinking is what got us into this mess?\n\nToday\u2019s guest is Mark C. Taylor, philosopher, cultural critic, and author of After the Human. Mark and Sean discuss the philosophical roots of climate change, the dangers of individualism, the false promise of techno-utopianism, and what it might mean to shift from seeing ourselves as isolated egos to members of a vast, interdependent web. They talk about AI, death, Hegel, Descartes, hope, and why ideas matter.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

I typically use a focal length between 24mm to 30mm (on an APS-C sensor). Wide enough for good coverage, but tight enough to reduce distortion. I just correct the lens distortions on post. \n\nThe camera is mounted on a C-stand, which is weighted and sturdy enough to support heavier rigs. It also lets me attach counterweights for stability, and even add a fill light or monitor on the opposite end.\n\nIf I\u2019m filming with audio, I always do a quick gain check to avoid clipping. Wireless mics are a must for this kind of setup because they\u2019re super versatile and easy to move around with.\n\nThen I hit the shutter and let the frame do the work. \u2728\n\nSave this for your next flat-lay shoot, and share this with a friend for their reference. Don\u2019t gate-keep! \n\nHappy start of the week, friends!\n\n#flatlayphotography #overheadshot #productphotographysetup #desksetupinspo #contentcreatorgear #creatorworkflow #cameraoverheadrig #photographytipsandtricks #homeofficesetup #cstandsetup #filmingsetup #shotonmirrorless #creativeworkflow #flatlayvideo #techflatlay #creatorstudio",

    "summary": "When Steve and Christine moved back to BC after being up in the Yukon for over a decade, they were looking to buy an affordable home in one of North America's most expensive cities: Vancouver, BC.  They were looking at small condos, but also stayed open to alternatives and ended up exploring float homes.  They found a 40-year old homemade float home for sale that was a definitely fixer upper, but they had no idea just how much work was needed until they started removing the flooring and had a roof leak and realized there was an ongoing water damage issue.  They ended up having to hire contractors to do some structural work, to replace the roof, and to add more styrofoam flotation, and they also did some aesthetic renovations themselves like redoing the floors, and putting in a new kitchen and bathroom.\n\nThe couple has created their dream home on the water \u2013 what they call the \"last affordable home in Vancouver\" \u2013 and they've lived there for just over a year with their dog Lozen and their cat Kitten.  They say that despite the unexpected renovations, living on the water has turned out better than they expected.  They love the community and neighbours at the marina, the proximity to both natural spaces and city amenities, and of course the affordability compared to a home on land.\n\nBut living on the water isn't without it's challenges.  The couple shares that moorage contracts at their marina are year-to-year so there is always a little bit of insecurity there, knowing that the marina owners could choose not to renew their moorage from one year to the next.  And there are also day-to-day quirks to live with, like the fact that the home sometimes \"bottoms out\" during really low tides, and that the exposed pipes can freeze during Vancouver's brief subzero winters.  But overall, Steve and Christine say they are really happy with their choice to live on the water.\n\nSpecial thank you to Maria Senajova for putting us in touch with Steve and Christine and for being such a great realtor for them :) \nhttps://www.vancouverurbanhomes.com/\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nSTAY IN TOUCH!\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWebsite: www.exploringalternatives.ca\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/exploringalternativesblog\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/exploringalternatives/\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nCOMMENTS\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe want our channel and comments section to be an inclusive space where everyone feels welcome to watch and contribute.

Her friends urged her to spend the money on something more sensible \u2014like a vehicle\u2014 but Elena, though only a student, was enchanted. \n\nShe bought the 18th-century megalithic home for the price of a car and spent the next 15 years making plans for the remodel worthy of its surroundings; Maina House is a megalithic home nestled among a 16th-century defense tower and a Byzantine chapel adorned with 12th-century frescoes.\n\nFifteen years later, with no road access, electricity, or plumbing, she began restoring the ruin stone by stone. Every tile, every beam, every tool had to be carried by hand up the winding path. In response, she designed a minimalist, bioclimatic home, deeply rooted in both the landscape and the traditional ways of the region.\n\nOver the decades, Elena\u2019s dream evolved into a 3-level, 150-square-meter tower-house that flows with the mountain itself. It opens to a cave below via a trapdoor staircase, and pays tribute to its centuries-old past at every turn. There's also a cave in the side yard that's used for summer siestas.\n\nNow a retreat shared with just two full-time residents of the tiny village, the home feels like a passage through time\u2014a lived-in relic that whispers of monastic solitude, fierce independence, and the quiet luxury of living with only what one truly needs.\n\nhttps://www.z-level.gr\nFor renting: https://www.mainagreece.com/\n\nOn *faircompanies: https://faircompanies.com/videos/she-got-ancient-hermit-tower-cave-chapel-for-the-price-of-a-car/",
